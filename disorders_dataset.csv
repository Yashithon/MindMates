I am grateful I can be an independent person.

"High-functioning depression: I feel like I'm living a double life. I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",negative,depression,2019-10-31 09:36:19

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

"Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses.

"I hate 'foggy brain syndrome' Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

"The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone",negative,depression,2020-09-13 22:48:37
"Depression = Losing intelligence The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

EDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love.",negative,depression,2020-08-24 20:37:27

I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for.

"I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I‚Äôm in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn‚Äôt show up. This was my attempt to ‚Äúreach out‚Äù. Update:

Sorry in advance, I‚Äôm on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn‚Äôt expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I‚Äôd like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I‚Äôd like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn‚Äôt know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn‚Äôt angry at her because I understand that she‚Äôs struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I‚Äôve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I‚Äôm going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn‚Äôt get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven‚Äôt dwelled on it too much. She‚Äôll reach out when she‚Äôs ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven‚Äôt heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what‚Äôs left of the family that supports me (not many people). I‚Äôm better off being out of that toxic environment but it‚Äôs still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I‚Äôm also struggling with my marriage. I‚Äôm a military spouse and it‚Äôs hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won‚Äôt go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it‚Äôs been traumatic and hard. I haven‚Äôt gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I‚Äôm in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn‚Äôt hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would‚Äôve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would‚Äôve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It‚Äôs okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I‚Äôm not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn‚Äôt meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",positive,depression,2020-11-22 21:19:02

"We only wish depression was being ""sad"". But depression is much more than that. 

It‚Äôs the excuses you have to make when you can‚Äôt make that meeting. 

It‚Äôs the friends and family you‚Äôve lost because you can‚Äôt explain why. 

It‚Äôs the opportunities that land in everyone else‚Äôs lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It‚Äôs the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It‚Äôs the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It‚Äôs your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It‚Äôs the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It‚Äôs the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It‚Äôs the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It‚Äôs not just being ‚Äúsad‚Äù. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did.

"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life. Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

"An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life.

"Being depressed and having depression are different. I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn‚Äôt understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I‚Äôm currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can‚Äôt get out of bed... I can‚Äôt do the dishes. I can‚Äôt pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can‚Äôt. 

I just.. I can‚Äôt hear the ‚Äúbut.. why are you depressed?‚Äù question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I‚Äôve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone‚Äôs life.

So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone.

I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we‚Äôre alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn‚Äôt let me.

"My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do? A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",positive,depression,2019-12-19 21:11:00

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",positive,depression,2019-10-29 14:52:02
"Why is it that people will call you lazy or weak for not wanting to do anything ever, but then will tell you that suicide isn't the answer? I never asked to be brought on this world, and yet I'm expected to be a ""normal adult"" and get a job, move out and maintain relationships (things that I've never known how to do). I feel like if I'll be by myself for a month I'll end it all honestly. I never asked for any of this. People think this excuse is playing the victim game, and they may be right, but why the fuck is suicide bad then? Am I supposed to rot on the streets instead? I'm just angry and I hate this.

I just have no energy and don‚Äôt feel like talking or doing anything. So please stop making me feel guilty for being this way, please stop being short and impatient with me, please give me time and space. 

Just please, stop assuming what mood I‚Äôm in and actually listen to me for once before you actually do put me in a bad mood.",negative,depression,2020-06-29 18:44:45
"I‚Äôm 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I‚Äôm getting more and more depressive Hi y‚Äôall,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I‚Äôm a 20yo man. I‚Äòm Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I‚Äôll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to ¬´¬†flirt¬†¬ª. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren‚Äôt as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it‚Äôs so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more ¬´¬†serious¬†¬ª¬†(important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn‚Äôt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it‚Äôs unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that clich√© of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‚Äòd have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn‚Äôt the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn‚Äôt stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I‚Äôd even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I‚Äôve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‚Äòm not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it‚Äôd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it‚Äôs extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents‚Äô for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents‚Äô and me at mine, there wasn‚Äôt even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It‚Äôs absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‚Äòd never forgive myself.
It‚Äôs an ongoing case so I‚Äôm not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn‚Äôt have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn‚Äôt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‚Äòll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it‚Äôs because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I‚Äôll be happy again and I‚Äòll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it‚Äôs wrong, first I‚Äòll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it‚Äôs unbearable to survive since she‚Äòs no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn‚Äôt now that I‚Äòm desperate without her that I‚Äòll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‚Äòll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I‚Äôm ¬´¬†relieved¬†¬ª that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don‚Äôt see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very ¬´¬†strong¬†¬ª and now I‚Äòm extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‚Äòre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‚Äòll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I‚Äôm not afraid of the judgement, I know they‚Äòll have a long sentence but I‚Äòm very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‚Äòre going to say, I‚Äòm anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I‚Äôm trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn‚Äôt want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it‚Äôs, when I‚Äôm there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don‚Äôt think anyone will have read this anyway.",positive,depression,2020-04-26 13:55:59

"I think my wife saved my life this morning. I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they‚Äôve kind of stopped working like they used to.

Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don‚Äôt have the money for the trip, but that‚Äôs ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

Many of these friends come to me when they are alone, depressed, or need advice. (Also he is the most glued to his phone type of person I have ever met). 

I am in therapy, and I get like regular people aren't qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic, but I guess I had hoped one of my friends would listen.

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy.

"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling. I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit.",positive,depression,2019-08-30 21:45:18
"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself"" I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around.

Nighttime is sort of like this void that is congruent with my state of mind. Nothing is happening. Everyone and everything is quiet. There are no expectations.

"Forcing myself to do things makes me hate them. Doing nothing makes me hate myself. The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn‚Äôt make you any less depressed. I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn‚Äôt help. 

There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with me. I‚Äôm young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I‚Äôve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I‚Äôve been told I am strong because I haven‚Äôt done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven‚Äôt killed myself. I‚Äôm not strong, I‚Äôm guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn‚Äôt cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the ‚Äúgood‚Äù therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn‚Äôt talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can‚Äôt help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn‚Äôt make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn‚Äôt matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won‚Äôt affect anyone.

"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything.

"The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly. If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk.",negative,depression,2021-02-19 22:21:28

"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

"I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold. I‚Äôve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4:30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it‚Äôd just be easier to end it all. I‚Äôve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. 

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn‚Äôt seem to help at all so I stopped going.

‚ÄúUm, you can afford alcohol but you can‚Äôt afford therapy?‚Äù She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people.

"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices. Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

"I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way.

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now.

All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness.

"Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?

I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted.

No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since. I've never once been thankful for not killing myself",negative,depression,2020-11-06 09:11:03

"I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he‚Äôs screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he‚Äôs done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?",negative,depression,2020-03-21 14:01:45
"Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older? Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10.

I'm tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me. I'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today.  Every fucking day.

"23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old. I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.

"I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do. I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

"Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure? I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes.

"I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",negative,depression,2019-12-12 22:05:02

I don't belong on this planet.

I don't belong anywhere.

I want to be away from all the hurt and loneliness.   I want to be away and dream nice things of love and joy and warmth and laughter and music.

"Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I‚Äôm so tired of existing. I‚Äôm so tired of being mad. I‚Äôm so tired of being tired. It‚Äôs pathetic. I‚Äôm a 25 year old adult who‚Äôs stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I‚Äôm reaching the point where I‚Äôm finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I‚Äôm going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I‚Äôll probably sink. If it‚Äôs sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can‚Äôt cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I‚Äôm such a glutton for punishment that I can‚Äôt bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive.

 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C‚Äôs in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying ‚Äúwell Don‚Äôt choke him (insert name)‚Äù and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not choking him‚Äù I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I‚Äôm going to get my ass beat I‚Äôm going to get my ass beat. I‚Äôm just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned we probably won‚Äôt ever speak again. Let‚Äôs start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to ‚Äúwake him up after rugrats‚Äù when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you‚Äôre 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn‚Äôt air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don‚Äôt remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there‚Äôs my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he‚Äôs in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse ‚Äúisn‚Äôt this okay because it‚Äôs what dad used to do to us. ‚Äú of course having a criminal record he couldn‚Äôt find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she‚Äôs gone it‚Äôll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it‚Äôs not full time and ‚Äúat your age your brother worked full time‚Äù at my age y‚Äôall gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It‚Äôs just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it‚Äôs a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I‚Äôm always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn‚Äôt want to help which wasn‚Äôt an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded ‚Äúforget it‚Äù and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother‚Äôs defense I‚Äôm a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don‚Äôt want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn‚Äôt take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn‚Äôt even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn‚Äôt want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don‚Äôt show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll need you tomorrow or not yet‚Äù so I just didn‚Äôt bother to show up because if y‚Äôall needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn‚Äôt going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn‚Äôt even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up ‚Äúwhy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn‚Äôt come‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do you get to sleep all day while we work I‚Äôm sick of it‚Äù turning to my mother ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of him aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall sick of him‚Äù (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won‚Äôt ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I‚Äôm running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I‚Äôm pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don‚Äôt care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn‚Äôt. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn‚Äôt despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said ‚Äúwell he wasn‚Äôt here for Christmas so I had to make it special.‚Äù I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I‚Äôm lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She‚Äôs talking some I can‚Äôt I don‚Äôt have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn‚Äôt want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I‚Äôm super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don‚Äôt know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn‚Äôt loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation‚Äù to which he responds (talking out of his ass) ‚Äúwell you didn‚Äôt pay for it mom did!‚Äù Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there‚Äôs not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I‚Äôm in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I‚Äôm literally holding onto grudges that I don‚Äôt know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I‚Äôm positive she‚Äôs forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I‚Äôm exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes ‚Äúare you ready now I‚Äôm not in a rush or anything‚Äù I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I‚Äôll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I‚Äôm ready to go lol. Otherwise I‚Äôd still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she‚Äôs overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I‚Äôm almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It‚Äôs been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I‚Äôm just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in a bad mood because I asked you to take me‚Äù my response being ‚Äúoh what I‚Äôm in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???‚Äù which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don‚Äôt understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I‚Äôm not mad and you tell me ‚Äúyes you are mad that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre being shitty‚Äù that‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you‚Äôre just going to decide I‚Äôm in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I‚Äôm in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying ‚ÄúI hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me‚Äù. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I‚Äôm inside of it, I hope it‚Äôs something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won‚Äôt be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn‚Äôt kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don‚Äôt care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn‚Äôt at fault for but still it‚Äôs a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn‚Äôt want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he‚Äôs cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn‚Äôt literally crying ‚Äúmommy bail me out‚Äù when he‚Äôs in there. As he‚Äôs going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me ‚Äúyour ashtray is knocked over ‚Äú as if i wasn‚Äôt outside and heard him kick it over like I‚Äôm supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of ‚Äúif he needs an ashtray he‚Äôll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.‚Äù Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. ‚ÄúWell it is your ashtray...‚Äù okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that‚Äôs the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she‚Äôs the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don‚Äôt want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I‚Äôve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn‚Äôt working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don‚Äôt feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don‚Äôt really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I‚Äôm chasing my mother‚Äôs approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It‚Äôs only been recently that I‚Äôm starting to come around to my father and that‚Äôs only because I think I‚Äôm starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I‚Äôve been and all that I‚Äôve been given. But I don‚Äôt know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm perfect either. I‚Äôve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that‚Äôs where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it‚Äôs just who you are and can‚Äôt be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn‚Äôt sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That‚Äôs fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn‚Äôt ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn‚Äôt the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don‚Äôt remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn‚Äôt have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that‚Äôs my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That‚Äôs probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn‚Äôt till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here‚Äôs the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I‚Äôm talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I‚Äôve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn‚Äôt me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we‚Äôre so sorry don‚Äôt even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn‚Äôt only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn‚Äôt care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That‚Äôs another one that‚Äôs my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I‚Äôve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I‚Äôm desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I‚Äôm tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I‚Äôm starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don‚Äôt think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don‚Äôt turn them into jokes. I‚Äôll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don‚Äôt want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I‚Äôm a scumbag. I‚Äôm starting to think my family is scumbags, and I‚Äôm genuinely losing my will to live. I‚Äôve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",negative,depression,2020-07-28 07:47:02
"My sister saved my life yesterday. There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on.",positive,depression,2020-05-06 15:31:12

I hate these questions. Because I can't see any lights in my future, only pain, stupidity and failure.

"Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy It‚Äôs such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don‚Äôt want to deal with any of it. 

It‚Äôs incredibly destructive but I honestly can‚Äôt help myself, as I‚Äôm too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with.

My drive to achieve any goals has faded.

A part of me doesn't  want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

"Today was my 21st birthday I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs. I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much.

I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards.

"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die."" This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love.",negative,depression,2016-11-15 13:05:44

Edit: I fell asleep shortly after making this post, and unfortunately I woke up. I ended up self harming, and I just feel worse. Some of you are very nonchalant about encouraging me to end it... but I am a coward. I can't even self harm enough to bleed all that much. I'm a total wimp. Literally not strong enough to do it of my own accord.

I could sit here and ramble about my fucking woes and horrible life circumstances, but I'm just... tired. Tired of explaining myself, tired of trying, tired of feeling like my heart is being ripped out of me.

To those of you who actually said something nice... thanks, but I've heard it all before. ""It could be worse"", ""I care about you"", ""It gets better""... It doesn't feel like it. Every time I end up feeling ""better"" my depression comes back worse and worse sooner or later. The self harming gets worse The thoughts of ending it all persist.

So.. what I'm trying to say is... I'm unfortunately still alive, and I still wish I wasn't.

Edit 2: I am alive. I've been on meds and I'm in therapy, but I'm looking into intensive outpatient care and will switch therapists once the evaluations I wanted to get done are done. I'm still holding on, somehow. Lots of you have helped. I still wish I didn't have so much pain and anxiety and sadness in my brain and body, but... some of you have inspired me to do something I hope will mean something to you. What that thing is, I'm not entirely sure yet, but it feels good to know people out here might actually want to see it.

"Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them. It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise.

"I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life. First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected. I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

I feel so tired of keeping up the mask. I can't carry on their expectation. Even if i want to, I can't handle it.",negative,depression,2020-03-19 17:17:52

"Do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about? Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid. Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself. 
This has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

Thank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;

Edit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; ‚ù§Ô∏è!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings

Edit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again. I've also saved some of your posts on my phone just as a reminder that I shouldn't be so hard on myself.",positive,depression,2021-06-11 17:50:24
"People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies. UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn‚Äôt seem to give a fuck, I‚Äôm meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she‚Äôs been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we‚Äôll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don‚Äôt care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It‚Äôs so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who‚Äôs really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it‚Äôs people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I‚Äôm trying to reply to each one but it‚Äôs hard to keep up, so I‚Äôm sorry if I miss yours. Remember‚Äîyou‚Äôre worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

"One of, if not the worst things about being depressed, for me, is that I have to force myself to do basic shit. I have to make an effort to maintain my body for example, or just get outta bed. Everything is labored and thought about beforehand. No enthusiasm even for hobbies. Force myself to do them So everything is labor in that way. I don't think people who don't have depression truly understand just how uphill it can seem. When everything has to be forced to be done or it just won't get done. It's exhausting and I'm already exhausted.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

"I‚Äôm fucking sick of my life but I‚Äôm too scared to die. I just hate everything. I‚Äôm so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer.¬†

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I‚Äôm being irritated by almost everything. I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel.¬†If I stop acting like I‚Äôm ok and someone notices I‚Äôm not feeling well, I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôm tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It‚Äôs not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it‚Äôs all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I‚Äôm worthless. I‚Äôm ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can‚Äôt even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don‚Äôt even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don‚Äôt want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it‚Äôs now or then?

"I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc. ""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships.",negative,depression,2019-05-10 03:04:41
"My parents told me to kill myself My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it.

"You can't kill yourself, think of your family! Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group.

"Regular Check-In Post Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",negative,depression,2021-01-31 12:52:31
"I don't know myself outside my mental illness Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT:   God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first.

"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?  

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?",positive,depression,2020-12-22 12:33:06

"My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

"My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him. Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough .

"I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do. I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again.

"I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin",positive,depression,2020-09-18 20:46:25

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I‚Äôve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I‚Äôve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn‚Äôt even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it‚Äôs cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I‚Äôll be fine. 

Bitch, I‚Äôm not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it‚Äôs just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, ‚Äúwell no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that‚Äôs not really an option.‚Äù

I‚Äôm so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I‚Äôm never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.

My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

"The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking ‚Äúthis really is my life after all‚Äù When you‚Äôre 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don‚Äôt define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you‚Äôre now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out.

"My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

"I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation) I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel.

"I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and.. I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester.

"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared. So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

"My girlfriend of 4 years died 2 days ago and I feel alone Growing up I had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives, but 2 days ago I watched my girlfriend die.  She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.  In those few seconds I lost my future and my other half. I feel so alone and don't really want to live anymore. I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do. And I want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would God take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me.

"Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years? I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

"Casually Suicidal Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don‚Äôt at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don‚Äôt want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can‚Äôt call myself depressed, because I‚Äôm not sad all the time. I can‚Äôt say I have anxiety, because I‚Äôm not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don‚Äôt tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I‚Äôm going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don‚Äôt exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I‚Äôm just feeling like this, that‚Äôs all.

"My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened. It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",positive,anxiety,2021-04-29 06:00:00

"At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I‚Äôll never forget EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you.

"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind. Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

"I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be. Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle.

We just talked about Christmas and she was telling me how she had to sell her house and how her son liked my car and I'm just sitting there shaking like a leaf.

I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.",positive,anxiety,2021-07-15 14:20:29
"Anyone feels like they live more in their head than in real life? So, I was wondering, anyone feel like this? 
I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. 
I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn‚Äôt. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I‚Äôm almost 22 years old now‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know if this is still a good thing.

"Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing? I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!",positive,anxiety,2020-08-02 20:52:54

And when I self talk that it doesn't even make sense - like who gives a fuck?  Losing my job would suck but I've never lost a job and my boss says I'm doing well.

Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

"How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

"I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness. I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fianc√©. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me.",positive,anxiety,2020-06-28 17:13:20

"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence? Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don‚Äôt mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort.

"People don't want to admit this but Anxietys root cause is because of the people you were raised with Yes we can say ""oh stop blaming your parents"" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its ""genetics"" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.

All I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. 

To adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big.

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head).

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

"I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder. I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",negative,anxiety,2020-10-23 01:11:57
"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled. I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",negative,anxiety,2021-04-30 12:19:38

"Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",positive,anxiety,2020-06-04 11:36:41

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

"I think I prefer depression over anxiety After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.

Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression.

"The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman.

"I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood. One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

"Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety Hey everyone,

I've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I‚Äôve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!

I have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!

**Body Oriented:**

* **Turn Your Room Cold** \- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.
* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \- It‚Äôs refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels.
* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \- If you‚Äôre lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.
* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your ""dive reflex,"" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.
* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.
* **Sit on the Floor** \- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.

**Mind Tricking:**

* **Spell Words Backward** \- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.
* **Count Things Around You** \- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.
* **Force Yourself to Smile** \- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you‚Äôre okay.
* **Do Some Math** \- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.

**Behavorial:**

* **Flip Your Environment Around** \- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.
* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.
* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.
* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work.
* **Gratitude** \- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.

**Environmental:**

* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution.
* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).
* **Smell Something Really Strong** \- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can ""shock"" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.

**Interactive:**

* **Carry Something Heavy** \- Holding something with weight can help ground you.
* **Balance on One Leg** \- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you.
* **Scribble** \- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you
* **Stare at Something Moving** \- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.

Some of these sound ridiculous, but they‚Äôve actually helped me, and I hope they can help you too!!!",positive,anxiety,2025-01-07 18:03:12

Even right now as I type this I think ‚ÄúOh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub‚Äù which is so in line with every obsession I have about being special, being great, being loved, etc ‚Äî and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

"Please start exercising I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck.

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself.

"My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer. It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",positive,anxiety,2021-04-16 16:26:08

Go to put one on and it doesn‚Äôt fit, none of them do. Now I‚Äôm having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I‚Äôm sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don‚Äôt fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn‚Äôt work that way.

"A stranger just came out of his way to tell me I was ugly I am a girl, 21, and today when I was walking out of work, I passed a guy who was sitting on a bench and he just told me I was ugly ( twice to make sure I could hear it). I suffer from severe anxiety and I tend to hide my face because when I feel like people are looking at me I always feel like they think I‚Äôm repulsive. I take care of myself as much as I can, I put effort in my makeup hair and clothing. I know I am not pretty, but I never thought it was to the point that someone would come out their way just to say it to me. It just confirms that everything i was imagining in my head is true. I want to hide forever. I feel worthless and disgusting. It‚Äôs so stupid I know it.

"I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it. SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you.",positive,anxiety,2018-08-13 20:15:05

"Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling? Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me

On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do.

"Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder? As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues.

"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine! (I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",negative,anxiety,2021-05-04 00:59:18

"UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.",positive,anxiety,2020-06-05 11:12:27

"I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

So my doctor, loosely translated, says, ""Well, what about a hurricane? It could be days, a week away from hitting. It's out in the ocean. You know it's there. So I guess you're safe now, huh? Because you know it's there.""

He went on to explain that you still have to board up your windows (take your meds), you still have to stock supplies (work on your anxiety exercises), you may have to consider leaving for a while until it's over with (distraction techniques)... anxiety is that hurricane. And you know it's coming. Your job (mine and all of yours) is to be prepared to lessen the impact as much as possible. Never be complacent, and work on your anti-anxiety methods even when you feel okay. Because in our world, there's always a hurricane out there. So be prepared for it.

So I started dancing because it‚Äôs the first thing I wanted to do, I‚Äôm usually never a softy like this, and I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to say it, but it‚Äôs the happiest I‚Äôve been since well before the epidemic started. Nothing else has matched this, not even my favorite videogame coming out, or my best friends birthday party, just me all alone, dancing Elvis style, like a basement dwelling rat. Something about it felt so liberating, I‚Äôve danced before but never in pure ecstasy like this. To be fair I‚Äôm extremely baked.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn‚Äôt wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it‚Äôs in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH.

"My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day. So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously.",positive,anxiety,2018-10-12 18:16:44

I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself!

"Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

The first week was terrible but as it's settling in, my anxiety is disappearing. I had no idea that my anxiety was as bad as it was until it disappeared. Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others? Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

"Stop telling me everyone has anxiety! I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it‚Äôs still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say ‚Äúoh well everyone has anxiety‚Äù. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say ‚Äúthank you for telling me.‚Äù

"This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure. I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

"Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?) Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",positive,anxiety,2020-03-01 06:31:05
"How to Breathe (a better way) Hey team!

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you‚Äôve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is ‚Äútake a breath!‚Äù  Great, I‚Äôll do that, thanks.  I‚Äôm going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and ‚Äúhigh up‚Äù (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you‚Äôre a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called ‚Äú[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)‚Äù.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That‚Äôs it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you‚Äôre calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I‚Äôve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  

Love,

"Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual. Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy.

"I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird? I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?",negative,anxiety,2018-07-23 02:33:58
"Does hearing the sentence ""I have bad news"" make your anxiety shoot through the roof? I *hate* when someone tells me that they have bad news. My stomach drops and all kinds of terrible scenarios run through my head. And 99% of the time the ""bad news"" ends up being something trivial like the grocery store is out of garlic powder.

"I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE!! I got my first acceptance letter today!!! High school was a pretty shit experience for me. Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn‚Äôt even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn‚Äôt be more proud right now. I‚Äôm IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

"Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off I live around Koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that I sigh a lot especially when I am stressed, but it doesn't mean I am upset necessarily or displeased with the person I am with, I just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this.

"Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in a rush to get things done even when they have nothing else they want to do? I don't know if this is anxiety linked or not but Ive always has this sense to rush things. I always want to get things done and completed, even enjoyable things sometimes. 

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc.

"After bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, I got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. I decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. I GOT THE JOB. I am seriously over the moon right now!  This is my DREAM JOB and I can't believe I scored it!  I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...

"My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",positive,anxiety,2021-05-06 23:25:09

"Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety. 25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",positive,anxiety,2020-02-11 20:35:18
"I am so proud of myself and I need to tell someone Two years ago I was too scared to leave my house. 

Today I decided to visit my dad an apply for an internship abroad. 

To visit my dad I have to travel by train for eight hours. Two years ago I couldn't get on the bus to go to college.

The internship will be ten weeks long. Two years ago I had panic attacks about going into the garden. 

I feel so extremely proud of myself, even if my family and friends don't understand. I'm starting to be myself again, even though I was never adventurous. 

I finally feel okay doing things on my own.


Edit: First off all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and awards. I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. 

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",positive,anxiety,2021-06-28 21:59:57
"Does anyone else occasionally have ""Time anxiety""? Time anxiety as in having anxiety that you won't ever have enough time to do something specific.

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

"I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

I cannot fix a chemical imbalance in my brain as easy as you fucking people make it sound like I can. Sometimes it gets bad enough to be seemingly out of my control. Your lack of good advice and your bullshit quick-fixes do not help at all.

"I was the only student to join the video chat this morning. Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

"A lot of bipolar people are stable, you just don‚Äôt hear from us. I‚Äôve been trying to get stable for six years and finally found Seroquel in 2019. It completely changed my life. 

I don‚Äôt really visit this subreddit that much because I really have no questions to ask. I‚Äôm doing really well so my mind is on other things and any bipolar-related issues I have, I have plenty of experience now and know pretty well what to do. So you don‚Äôt hear from me at all.

I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs important to realize that many people are like me. Scrolling through posts, it may seem like a horrific prognosis and endless problems, but in reality, *only those who need support post here*. The people who are stable don‚Äôt typically regularly browse Internet forums so there is really zero representation of people like me.

I have a few different diagnoses and it can seem like life is hell, based on the Internet forums. The majority of subreddit forum members are seeking support because they are having a difficult time. Those that are stable and well managed don‚Äôt post because they are off living their life and don‚Äôt need advice.

I have been the most depressed I have ever been in my life since last October, and this had been the state of my room and bathroom since about last November! I started medication specifically for bipolar (I‚Äôve only ever been on ADHD stimulants and one anxiety med that did nothing for me lol) and seeing a counselor again and it‚Äôs only been a few weeks but I really do feel a bit better.

My apartment has room inspections (it‚Äôs student housing) this evening so I have been cleaning my room and bathroom since I woke up. Last time we had inspections I was still very depressed and (as you can tell by the before pictures) definitely failed them.

I still need to mop, declutter my desk and shelf area, organize my closet and cabinets, and clean my toilet and shower (pardon the closed lid and pulled curtains lol), but I feel so so so much better than I have in half a year.

6 years ago, my life completely derailed after i had dropped out of college due to this disorder. The first few years were hard. Mostly focused on making it through the next day.

Today i am coming back to my apartment from a work party in new york (where i now live and work)
I‚Äôm working on building friendships here and i‚Äôve been dating a wonderful woman for the past 3 months

"Art I made while stable on meds! I know a lot of ppl with bipolar feel flat on medication and I see a lot of posts of art made during mania. Everyone's experience is valid, but I didn't look at my hypomanic episodes with any sort of fond ess or desire to experience it again. 

Before my diagnosis I was very creative, mostly fiber arts, and I always had so many unfinished projects and ideas. My inspiration outpaced my physical ability to crochet fast enough lol. 

Since I got diagnosed and started meds, I've experienced true boredom for the first time in my life. 

Since stabilizing after an intense post manic crash, I've felt my creativity returning. I'm feeling inspired and enjoying the newness of the mediums I'm working with.

I had to repost this bc I accidentally left my signature on the portrait of my dog (that's why it's cropped weird)

The finished dog portrait I made for his 15th birthday. The portrait of my little dog is obviously a work in progress!

It is not the hypersexuality or the inability to sleep or the reckless behaviour. It is not even the suicidal and self-destructive urges that tell you that it's all hopeless so just give up.

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

It is not our fault that we have PTSD but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others. The amount of blame I'm seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with PTSD has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst.

Imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way.

Why is it that if I can't forgive I can't move past it (to them)? Why do they think that because I 'can't forgive' that I'm always thinking about it, brooding resentment?

Why can't they just accept that I've been hurt? I will never forget what happened, and it doesn't mean I am dwelling on it and creating resentment in my heart. My intrusive thoughts are not proof that it is constantly on my mind and that it's a sign that I need to just forgive and forget and move on to heal.

This weird obsession with healing in not healthy! Sometimes there is no healing, there is only managing whats left. Sometimes there is never resolution. Sometimes, the person whose been hurt decides the pain is not worth it. Why is that not acceptable? Why is it being a coward?

"Trauma comes out when you feel safe and human again. Damn, ain't that some shit? You feel good about yourself, better then you felt in years or you get away from your abusers or you finally feel free of everything then *BAM*  the bullshit starts.

"Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response 
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need anyone, I‚Äôll just do it all myself‚Äù conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together‚Äù or ‚ÄúI got you‚Äù then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn‚Äôt really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don‚Äôt put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won‚Äôt have to be disappointed when they don‚Äôt show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don‚Äôt trust anyone.

And you don‚Äôt trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

‚ÄúNever again,‚Äù you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it‚Äôs your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It‚Äôs a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, ‚ÄúYou rest. I got this.‚Äù And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don‚Äôt have to earn it.
You don‚Äôt have to prove it.
You don‚Äôt have to bargain for it.
You don‚Äôt have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.
Simply because you exist.

"Is it discouraging to anyone else when you look up questions about your ptsd and all it is is military stuff? I have so many questions I want to look up, but even basic things lead straight back to veterans. It makes me feel ashamed for having my trauma.

Edit: I have no issues with veterans and them getting resources to help. My uncle works for a VA hospital in Georgia and there I saw first saw what PTSD was like. I thought for a long time only vets got it, then years later when I got diagnosed there were no resources for me to understand why. It makes my trauma feel less traumatic to see that still today, 10 years later, only veterans and sometimes r*pe survivors have readily available resources.",negative,ptsd,2019-11-18 14:30:09
"Does anyone else get strong urges to cry when explaining your feelings regardless if it‚Äôs related to your trauma or not? Whenever I‚Äôm upset about something, big or small, and im explaining to people what‚Äôs upsetting, tears immediately flow without my control and my voice cracks and my body becomes super tense. It happens all the time. Even at work if im trying to explain something to my superiors and i think i might get in trouble. It makes me feel super weak and like I can‚Äôt handle myself. And i feel like people think im crazy over emotional. 

Just recently my bf and i had a civil disagreement. I can‚Äôt even remember what exactly it was about, but i ended it with a point he couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt refute and instead of concluding the conversation he just disengaged by turning away from me while im talking to look at his phone and read random forums. It was only mildly annoying but i found myself crying just trying to explain why i felt that was disrespectful which makes me look and feel like I‚Äôm overreacting. 

Am i alone in this? Does this kind of thing happen to anyone else? Im still kind of new to the idea of having ptsd, ive been diagnosed with it last year around this time due to physical abuse i suffered growing up.",negative,ptsd,2020-06-08 20:12:54

She immediately became more cold and even called me a pussy and sick because I‚Äôm ridiculing others that actually have PTSD and have been traumatized by blaming all my petty problems to fake PTSD.

"I am a victim of child sexual abuse. Last night, I finally took control back over my life. I recorded my abuser's confession to the crimes he committed against me and other children. There is an active investigation into my abuser, and last night I did something very difficult to do. I confronted him about him coercing me and forcing me to perform sexual acts with him when I was a child. 

Next week I have an appointment to meet with the detective in charge of the case. The video of him confessing and repeatedly apologizing is over 20mins long. It's damning and will just be icing on the cake of a VERY big case against my abuser. 

As of now, only 2 weeks into this investigation with no publicity, there are 4 young boys including myself that we know of that were raped and molested by this man. 

I have on tape his confession to 3 of them. 

The weeks leading up to this moment were rough. The decision to take this step was entirely mine. I'm finally taking back control over the situation. I can't take away the fact that I was abused for many years by him, or take it away for the others. But today... Today I can say I have taken more steps to prevent it from happening to any others. I can take control over my future somewhat. 

Stay strong friends. I wanna thank this community (and others) for the help, advice and understand I've received from many of you, on more than 1 reddit account. (I try to spread it out so that nobody can find it all together and figure out who, what, where to remain anonymous as possible.)

"Warning: ""The Body keeps the score"" is a disrespectful and damaging book on PTSD with wide acclaim So I bought the book ""The body keeps the score"" after it was recommended by a mental health youtuber. And I am disturbed at the cult following this book has gained despite spreading very damaging and false information and views.

I have not read beyond chapter 1 and I don't want to.

&#x200B;

1. Author encourages sympathy for war criminals
2. Author dismisses Vietnamese genocide
3. Author devalues trauma of non-Veteran PTSD victims. This is damaging to the PTSD community as it is a widespread and false stereotype that only Veterans ""deserve"" to claim PTSD. Meaning it goes widely undiagnosed. In reality less than 5% of PTSD sufferers are Veterans. It has taken DECADES to dispell this stereotype and he just reintroduced it. Good job.
4. Author expresses his opinion that the suffering of Veterans is greater than that of rape victims. Which is weird and highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist. It doesn't matter if one persons pain is not as great as another's, they still deserve to seek help. It's made even weirder by how he defends and expresses sympathy for actual rapists. Going as far as saying ""they were traumatised by their own actions"" WTFFFF????
5. That's not trauma, that's guilt. By definition, trauma is something that happens to you, a psychiatrist should know that.
6. Author references the Nazi's but doesn't actually condemn their actions which is suspicious. In fact he seems to be on the wrong side of the Nuremberg trials. While at least the Nazis could claim that they were following orders, the Veterans he defends committed their rape and child murder out of fun
7. He is Dutch, which is where I live. Therefore I know he would have had to read Hannah Arendts ""the banality of evil"" in high school and been exposed to thought experiments and debates on whether following orders counts as warcrime and how much personal responsibility soldiers have since 1st grade. He even grew up during the Nuremberg trial, and claims his father was imprisoned in a concentration camp during WW2. It's not like he is an American who has never been exposed to or had to actually think about these topics. It's like he came up with a strange twisted defence of warcrime to rationalise what happened to his father.
8. The message of the book seems to be ""forgive your rapist, he suffers more from the trauma of your rape than you do""

And don't even get me started on all the scientific inaccuracies and absolute lack of references. All his claims are based on personal experience supported by anecdotes. It referenced discredited techniques, like Rorschach tests, seriously? This book came out in 2016. I legitimately thought this book predates ""Banality of evil"" and the Nuremberg trial considering how immature and underdeveloped his theories are.

Absolute garbage! Hope it gets cancelled before it does more damage to the PTSD community. This is the equivalent of the ""vaccines cause Autism""- paper for PTSD.

EDIT:

Since so many people are trying to gaslight me into denying that what I say actually happens in the book, I wanted to share a quote I found on the goodreads review page of this book, so that you have more than just me as a source that this book is problematic, and that the things I state actually happen in ch1.

"" As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely‚Äîif ever‚Äîdon't finish a book, but I'm shelving this one. [(less)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score#) "" sep 2019

EDIT 2

His Rorschach study was plagiarised from a Rorschach study during the Nuremberg Trials on Nazi War criminals. Nothing wrong with repeating a study, but he doesn't credit it whatsoever and portrays it as though he came up with the idea to Rorcharch test war veterans.

"As a veteran As a veteran, I just want to say that even if you do didn't serve, I know your PTSD is real.

I question if I had PTSD prior to my military experience. I've had childhood trauma that feel a lot like my combat trauma. I can easily see how the two are similar.

Unfortunately, it's much easier to get taken seriously if you are a Veteran. The VA is very aware of the issue and has plenty of resources. I thank God that I found this path to help me with my mental health struggles.

Rape jokes really aren‚Äôt funny I was repeatedly raped and physically abused by a romantic partner of mine.

"Update: I told my Dad 14F here. So this morning I posted here about whether I should tell my dad about my mom‚Äôs abuse. He didn‚Äôt know because she would only do it when he was at work or deployed. After reading all of the supportive comments and advice, I decided to tell him. Some of you advised that I showed him the post or write a letter, and I decided to do the latter. 

Basically I explained in the letter that she would explode in anger when I did something wrong and briefly described the incidents I talked about in my previous post. I also admitted that the abuse was causing me to be suicidal. I then said I had been scared of telling him because I didn‚Äôt want to cause the end of their marriage and his job, but I needed to tell him because it had been getting worse and worse and I needed help. 

I had the letter written and when my Dad got home from work I asked to talk to him. We went up to my room, he sat on my bed, and I gave him the letter. It‚Äôs hard to describe what I was feeling in that moment. Knowing that our whole lives could change when he read it, for better or worse. I watched his face as he read it and had my hands clasped so tightly together to stop them from shaking that it hurt. His face said a lot. His eyes widened really big, and then he looked really sad. 

When he finally finished the letter, he got up and hugged me. He then started crying. My dad doesn‚Äôt cry often, and I‚Äôve never seen him cry this much. He kept saying how sorry he was. I just stood there let him hug me. The relief I felt that he believed me was immeasurable. When he let go, he held onto my hands and asked if I would be okay up here while he went to talk to my mom. He looked worried, and I was confused at first until I realized he probably asked because I said I was suicidal. I told him I would, and that I wasn‚Äôt actively suicidal. There were just times, usually right after she‚Äôd hurt me, that I felt that way. He looked pretty broken up by that but he nodded and told me to pack some clothes and things because we would likely leave for the night and go to a hotel. 

While I was packing I could hear them. My Mom was denying it at first, but I guess my dad shut that down because then she started crying and screaming about how I was literally useless around the house and would never make it in the world if I didn‚Äôt mature. I should mention that in my 14 years, my dad never once raised his voice at my mom. She was always the yeller of the family, even to him sometimes. But he yelled at her that I was a child not her servant, and that abusing me would not prepare me for adulthood, it would prevent me from getting to adulthood. I got chills when he said that. 

A couple minutes later, he came back up, gave me another hug, and told me we were going to stay at a hotel for the night. I asked if they were getting a divorce, and he said yes, but it wasn‚Äôt because of me. He said he couldn‚Äôt be married to an abuser, and thanked me for telling him. He said he was so sorry that he didn‚Äôt know sooner, and that as soon as things got settled, he would get me therapy because knowing I had ever felt like I wanted to die had scared him a lot, and he wanted to everything he could to help me never feel like that again. 

Aaaand that‚Äôs when I started crying. It was a good few minutes before we actually left. He just held me while I cried out all that stress that had been building. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was really over. I‚Äôm in the car now with him on the way to the hotel. I tried asking about his job and custody but he said that he would worry about all that, but that he would tell me once he got everything sorted out. He also said public school could be scary but nothing like my mom made it out to be (I was homeschooled and she was using the threat of public school as one of the things to keep me from telling him) but that was another thing that would come in time, he said.

Thank you to everyone here who gave me the courage to tell him the truth. Uncertain times are far from over, but I can finally feel safe and protected, and that I‚Äôm not alone. Telling him was probably the hardest but best thing I‚Äôve ever done, and it looks like overall things are looking up.

"I was raped by a woman - I‚Äôm a man. I feel invisible and invalid. I don‚Äôt want to go in too in-depth, but I was raped via envelopment in 2022 by a woman. 

I said stop multiple times, she got aggressive and essentially pinned me down and continued when I tried to stop her. I didn‚Äôt want to wake her roommate up or make her more mad than she already was. I kinda just gave up and embraced the nauseating pain.

"Let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room Every time you see PTSD symptoms online or elsewhere, they include the classic symptoms such as flashbacks, hyper vigilance, etc. However, nobody talks about another common symptom, minimizing your trauma. Saying things like, ‚ÄúWhat happened to me wasn‚Äôt that bad. Others have been through worse.‚Äù The reason why we do this is because it‚Äôs our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it‚Äôs just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That‚Äôs all I have to say. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",negative,ptsd,2021-03-18 19:52:49

"LOL, SO MY RAPIST JUST LANDED HIS ASS BACK IN PRISON! I know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations.

Just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles.

Now I'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. Probation violation :) Actually, twelve of em, but who's counting?

**He has** ***nothing*** **left**.

He has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-known local reputation, and probably his marriage. And, let's be real: the rest of his future.

And now he has to live out the rest of his life in the wreckage of everything he used to have. Plus 5-10 *extra* years in lockup.

""I'm going to end this man's whole career,"" I seethed ten years ago, helpless and blinded by untreated PTSD.

""It's okay, I'll ruin my own whole life,"" was his reply, apparently.

Life is pretty good nowadays on my end. I don't wake up screaming or begging anymore. I have a lot worth living for. Most days, I'm pretty happy.

Meanwhile, the man who ruined half a dozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :)

*Was it worth it, my good bitch? Would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?*

"Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD? Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?

I usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. 

I want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. 

((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))

I am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.

"It annoys me when trauma survivors say their trauma made them a better and stronger person I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. 

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. 

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, ""Rape made me better"" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.

**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this. Thank you**",positive,ptsd,2018-06-20 15:04:58
"Annoying trend: Casual use of the term ptsd/triggered in pop culture Not to be that overly offended person, but I feel like I've heard a lot of flippant use of the term PTSD lately. Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. 

It just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. 

Don't even get me started on the ""hashtagtriggeredüòã"" stuff.  Like: Oh my god, I hate that girl, I'm so triggered right now #triggeredlol. (I don't mean legit use of triggered, I mean I've seen stupid uses that I feel devalue the actual term and make me hesitant to even use it properly cos I feel stupid saying it.)

Like, occasionally I'll use it meta/ironically in a self deprecating way, to let my partner know I actually am being triggered but don't want to get too emotional about it. I get that being sincere about trauma is hard. But in general, it's just a joke to so many people these days. It grinds my gears üò©


I'm not sure if anyone gets what I mean, but I feel it makes it harder to talk about and even take myself seriously when I'm trying to hard to work through trauma.

"I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.

I'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.

But somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.

Then on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.

It was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.

I took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.

My manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically ""either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.""

Three of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were ""triggering"" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.

I have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been ""too much to handle"" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just ""feel like a burden"", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.

My support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, ""Great. Scared another one away.""

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.

I don't even know what I'm asking for. I'll take advice, or even just acknowledgement. If you've read this far, thank you. I just needed to be heard and I didn't know where else to turn.",negative,ptsd,2022-08-10 19:03:24

"Feeling trapped, rapist is getting more famous and I‚Äôm struggling to avoid his face I am struggling a bit this week and trying to mentally prepare for the next few months. My rapist has gotten a little famous over time. He is a political commentator so his profile tends to somehow make it into my news feed/facebook/tik tok even though I avoid politics, blocked him on tik tok, etc. I block and avoid these things to avoid seeing him. The tik tok I saw yesterday he had over 500,000 likes and it‚Äôs concerning me he‚Äôs getting more famous which means his face will be tormenting me more often. My close friend who I was living with posted him on instagram and when I asked her to take it down in a panic she told me how she thinks he‚Äôs so funny. I previously reported him to the police and then again to the FBI. I just don‚Äôt want to live like this, it‚Äôs so stressful for me. He was my first experience and it was particularly prolonged and violent so it had a huge negative impact on my life and the PTSD was all encompassing. It‚Äôs been over a decade since then and I‚Äôm just getting frustrated.

"r/ptsd will not be joining the blackout Thank you to those who expressed their concerns and voted in the poll this weekend.    While there was slightly more votes (only about 20) for joining the blackout, the difference was minimal, and important points were raised why we shouldn't join the blackout.

Therefore, the mods of r/ptsd have made the decision not to close or restrict r/ptsd during the protest of the API changes from 12th to 14th of June.  Anything can happen in 48 hours, and for those who may need support most, we don't want to take this platform from them.  Unlike what reddit is doing to people with disabilities.

We do however still support other subreddits going dark temporarily and permanently, and the mods will be individually participing in the protest in other ways.  We invite you to find ways to protest (respectfully) as well.  What reddit is doing is not acceptable and will have detremental effects to the platform. More details are available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

"Shoutout to all of the people with PTSD that have horrible memories My memory has been deteriorating a lot over the last few months, and I recently learned that it probably stems from trauma. Apparently PTSD can wreak long-term havoc on the brain (which makes sense, I just hadn‚Äôt thought about it before) and has a particularly nasty effect on the hippocampus.

I‚Äôm young, maybe younger than most people on the sub, and memory loss has always been one of my biggest fears. So to learn that PTSD can permanently effect my memory and double my chance of developing dementia later on, is taking a toll on me. 

If anyone else has been affected like this, hi, you‚Äôre not alone. Shit sucks but we‚Äôll all get through it.

Edit: I didn't expect this to even hit Hot, but I'm so glad so many of us can relate, and all in different stages of it.

i get it‚Äôs public information and people are more curious about the taboo.. i don‚Äôt mean to react out of emotion and pain. 
it just hurt so much, they didn‚Äôt ask for permission, NO notification.. just made a multiple part podcast ‚Ä¶ years later.. and it gained enough traction to be sent to my parents and I.. and it really triggered me more than I thought it would and felt blindsiding
and as a younger person- I understood that these podcasts ( even if my sensitivity doesn‚Äôt understand the enjoyment) are a thing and there is a huge market.. but I had to explain to my older parents first- what a podcast is, but also how they could be allowed to do this? 
It just hurts so bad. They don‚Äôt know rlly how to use their phones , so luckily they can‚Äôt play it / fully navigate the site , so I am the one emailing and there was crime scene photos on the website without warning. 
And then, I‚Äôm an idiot so I listened. 
It started with an upbeat plug for their merch :D, light banter and even a moment where they described elements of his death ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù‚Ä¶

And it‚Äôs such a heavy topic, so I don‚Äôt know how to talk about it. I have work tomorrow and I just idk it all feels like so much 

If you read this much, thank you
also- is there a support group for that kind of situation ?

Edit; thank you all so so much for the acceptance, resources and just respect. it means so much..
i do not intend on taking legal action or anything - just rather contact to see if they tried to reach out to us - and then maybe ask them to at least take the crime photos off the website - because it‚Äôs one thing for me to have clicked the podcast.. that was my choice.. but the photos on the site is excessive.",negative,ptsd,2022-08-14 03:18:25

"The person who sexually abused me was denied parole with no chance for another hearing! The hearing was today. I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim‚Äôs and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won‚Äôt be.¬† The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.¬† There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away.

"Just a tiny rant: I hate how pop psychology and social media has ruined certain terms like 'trauma,' 'disassociation,' and 'intrusive thoughts.' If you're in the older crowds you might now see this as much but I hate how these words became little trendy quirks to have or use as memes on social media. I've also kind of just resented how they've become part of mainstream vernacular and not in a good way you know? 

For example I saw someone describe an incident where their friend read their journal too their crush in 7th grade as ""traumatizing"" like...genuinely they believe they have trauma from this. It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's ""Don't compare your trauma to others,"" and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.

I also hate how terms like ""disassociate"" or ""intrusive thoughts"" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated.

I had written a note, made plans, I woke up sobbing this morning and just couldn't bear it any more, i was just so overwhelmed.

Eventually I decided if I was going to do it, I would need to set her up to be more comfortable for the day (its really hot here) and got up and moved to go and set her up her bed and food in a different cooler part of the house. Moving helped a little bit, but I was still in that headspace. She wouldn't settle until I came and sat on the sofa with her, and she just laid out staring at me. Something about the look I her eyes was just so innocent and pure and it set me off crying and sobbing again, the idea that she wouldn't know what had happened to me if I killed myself. I decided to take a nap, I figured if I was going to do it anyway then who cares of I slept till 3pm anyway first. I woke up calmer. Sure the whole day was wasted sleeping but i woke up at the end of it...I came down from bed and sat with her on the sofa after and I don't know...

I have not opened the link. Maybe it is totally benign and wouldn't bother me at all. Or maybe I'll open it and the anxiety will ensue. I would rather not find out.

I do not expect everybody in my life to cater to my needs or walk on eggshells because of my PTSD. I do, however, expect someone like my Uncle to use common sense and not send me something that obviously hits way too close to home.

This is a vent, not about my uncle and his actions, but about the lack of PTSD education to the general public. I don't believe he sent me that link to be mean. I genuinely believe he does not understand that it could cause me distress.",negative,ptsd,2021-05-04 15:00:27

Do people assume you‚Äôre ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or ‚Äúslow‚Äù because of trauma symptoms?

I‚Äôve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I‚Äôm not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear ‚Äúslow‚Äù because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I‚Äôm slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I‚Äôm

"Is it common to downplay or even question your trauma? To feel that your pain isn‚Äôt valid, that you‚Äôre making it up, that you have no right to suffer because of it? I could always acknowledge that I had some bad experiences in my childhood. My mom was bi-polar, an alcoholic and addict. My dad traveled for work and when he was home, he ignored what was happening. I spent most of my childhood being the protector of my younger brother.

Anyway, I‚Äôve had anxiety and depression my whole life (as far back as I can remember), but this past year it has been particularly bad. Inpatient stays, outpatient, therapy, etc. A few weeks ago, I started having flashbacks, and my mind just can‚Äôt stop thinking of the things that happened. 

I‚Äôve been angry. At first, it was towards my mom, but lately I just feel angry at myself. I think things like, ‚Äúdid this even happen? why am I making such a big deal out of this? Do I just want attention? Do I just want to feel bad for myself? I didn‚Äôt know exactly what was causing my anxiety and depression, so have I just resorted to blaming it on my childhood? Was it even that bad? I just need to suck it up, stop thinking about it, it‚Äôs over and I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

"I killed my mom tw: sexual abuse, physical abuse  
  

I don't want to drag this on so to put it shortly: my mom did bad things to me when I was little. I visited my hometown and lived with her for a few months recently and it was a nightmare. I started feeling sick and my relationship with my mom was just as bad as it had always been growing up. When I went home I was still sick and I was supposed to start treatment for PTSD once I got into therapy again. I watched her hurt my dad over and over as a kid. She took me in the shower and told me I smelled bad that I wasn't showering right, and she would touch me and threaten me. She told me to kill myself and to hurt myself so many times. She was on drugs most of my lifetime. I stopped talking to her because she was my trigger and I had no respect left for her. She tried to contact me and taunt me saying she was going to take my tax money again, I called and my aunt picked up, I was very upset and started yelling. I sent my mom a long text message, confronting her about everything she did to me, it wasn't very nice but I was so angry. I told her I hoped she would never die. My family saw the text and told me they'd believe me no matter what, to tell them what my mom did to me, specifically about the sexual abuse. I was already broken down I just told them everything. They didn't believe me and got angry for accusing my mother of such things. My mom sent me a picture of a gun to her head, and I did not respond. I did not want to talk to her anymore. She shot herself shortly after. I don't know what to do. I spent the rest of the day with my friends drinking and getting high and laughing. I cried a lot too but I didn't want to be sad. I don't know if I feel sad or relieved. My entire family is angry with me. I need help",negative,ptsd,2022-01-27 16:23:54

"I see a lot of posts hating on the overuse of the word ""survivor,"" claiming that you're not one if you were never at risk of dying. They're wrong. There are more ways to die than just physically. Some of us experienced things that pushed us beyond our ability for parts of us to survive. Some of us can't even pretend we are who we used to be anymore because the pain and the fear destroyed that person. If you ask me, that's not surviving. My joy didn't survive.

"I don't like them taking away the word ""victim"". There's a real push in PC culture right now for not just people with PTSD but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves ""victim"" but rather ""survivor"". The problem with that is, I WAS victimized. That kind of language benefits the people who harm us, because if they see us as ""survivors"" than they can go on abusing us and it's like it doesn't matter. You can do anything to a ""survivor"". Also, it shames people coming forward because the word ""victim"" has become negative and shameful. I think instead of replacing ""victim"" with another word, we should be making it so that ""victim"" is not a shameful thing to be. You hear whining mostly on the right, mostly aimed at women, about people, mostly women, accused of ""playing the victim"". The solution to that isn't to call yourself something else, but to assert that yes, I am a victim, but no I am not playing or pretending. This all actually happened to me. If I were a ""survivor"" I feel like that just makes me violable because I'm then expected to be ""tough enough"" to ""handle it"". It puts pressure on victims by telling US to get over it and cope and be strong, rather than pressuring abusers to change THEIR shitty patterns of behavior. I understand that individual people might like feeling like a ""survivor"", but I feel like the label is toxic because it's telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized. I do want to be a victim, because I was one, and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself. 

This was also brought up in the second season of *Thirteen Reasons Why*, and I thought, like many mental health issues in that show, that it was handled in such a garbage way. Basically, a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party. She has a hard time getting over it. A feminist in charge of a ""rape survivors"" group tells her to join them ""when you're ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor"". In other words, her shaming the character into being the right kind of ""strong survivor"" type of person, and being sad was seen as weak. She was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist. The show acted like it was important that she do that, no sympathy for victims who do not report. I feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence, where we bully, ridicule, and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged.",negative,ptsd,2020-02-09 14:00:35

This also come along with me downplaying things which is a coping mechanism of mine. Like telling myself my trauma ""isn't even that bad"" or that it doesn't warrant PTSD etc. 


Now I can rationalise these thoughts because my physical symptoms aren't fake. I can't stop the shaking and the hyperventilating. I also hate attention/being fussed over, if anything I get extremely embarrassed. But I was wondering if this is a typical thing?

"Am I a Karen for being a little bothered when people without PTSD joke about having it?

For example, if my friend opened a new bag of chips and it exploded everywhere they might say the next time they open a bag ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be so careful this time I have PTSD from the last time it exploded‚Äù.

Basically telling me that I have to deal with whatever people say or call me because of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù. I ended up taking it down and just keeping the post up here because of it. It didn‚Äôt bother me that people were saying I was in the wrong, but the hurtful and arrogant comments were ridiculous. Just goes to show that most people have no idea what PTSD is. They think it‚Äôs about as big as someone going to war and being scared of fireworks after. Which everyone in this subreddit can vouch could not be further from the reality we live every day. It makes me really sad that people aren‚Äôt only uneducated on the topic, but unwilling to learn. PTSD is such a heavy and all consuming disorder, and it‚Äôs constantly shit on. I wish there were more organizations or promo of PTSD awareness. I felt so alone and overwhelmed until I started reading these comments.

"I identify more with 'victim' than with 'survivor' Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. 

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.",negative,ptsd,2021-12-05 15:56:12

"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life.

"My patient died a violent death and I think I have PTSD from it Tldr: He suffered a cardiac tamponade that led to sudden onset hypotension, and his IV got pulled out, which led to hypovolemic shock.

The patient had come to the hospital, complaining of severe chest pain and weakness, and had said he suffered clots before, so he was given blood thinners to treat it. Around 12:50 AM i got a call from his room. It was his wife, screaming about excessive bleeding and her husband throwing up. 

I stepped into his room, and it was like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I truly do not mean to crassly compare it to something like but I have no idea how else to express it. As soon as I stepped into his room I went into instant panic mode because of what I saw. I froze up. My mind went blank.

His bed was so saturated in blood  that it went through all of his linens and was covering the mattress. His blankets were so soaked that it was dripping on to the floor. His gown was completely black because he was so bleeding out so much. His IV had been torn out of his arm and he was just pouring blood everywhere.

I tried so hard to stop it. The floor was slick with his blood that I fell and nearly split my own head open trying to get to the emergency staff button. I tried so hard. The towels. The gauze. There just so much bleeding that it went through everything.

His face turned so white. I had never seen anything so terrifying in my life. All i can see when I close my eyes is the color draining from his face.

His blood pressure went from 127/79 to 42/30. He was dead at 1:35 AM.

I don't know what to do. I've changed my clothes. I've written this out. I cried. But all I can think of is all that blood. His dying face. He was shaking so much.

He came in and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism when he had a cardiac tamponade and we gave him blood thinners for a clot that didn't exist.

I can't help but think we killed him. I can't stop thinking what if I had gotten there a few minutes earlier? What if I hadn't froze at the door?

"I was stabbed 18 times and pushed off a cliff, and that was the easy part I was attacked while hiking in Honolulu in 2009. An individual had a psychotic break and thought Japanese men wearing blue were government agents sent to kill him. I was stabbed 18 times, mostly in the head and throat, and pushed off the top of Koko Crater. I fell 100 feet. I broke my neck, fractured my skull, both my lungs collapsed, my left lung was punctured, my liver and diaphragm were stabbed, an artery in my temple was severed.
I lost 5 pints of blood. I was lucky to survive, there have been a few challenges along the way. 

I was rear-ended twice while recovering from the broken neck. I was betrayed by the justice system. My attacker was acquitted due to temporary insanity and was put in a mental hospital.
Just 3 years after trying to murder 2 people, he was granted permission to take college courses at a nearby community college unescorted.
He was released in 2018 and gets free healthcare for life. 

In 2021, I was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder that causes complete fat loss.
Every ounce of fat disappears and your organs slowly shut down. I haven‚Äôt laid on my back in 2 years and I haven‚Äôt sat voluntarily in 2 years because my butt fat is gone. Most of my life is spent laying on my stomach. 

It won‚Äôt surprise you that I have PTSD, what might surprise you is that the trauma from my stabbing is a drop in the bucket compared to the trauma of chronic illness. I survived and even overcame maybe the most violent attempted murder ever committed, and yet I‚Äôm taken down by a rare metabolic disorder. Life without fat is exponentially more painful than getting stabbed and pushed off a cliff. Crazy, right? 

People ask how I‚Äôve survived all this trauma. The answer is simple: I‚Äôm half Japanese and half  Scandinavian. That means I‚Äôm a samurai AND Viking. It‚Äôs hard to kill one, but I‚Äôm both! 

This is a challenging situation and I worry about the future, but I post this to remind you of the strength of the human spirit. I hope this part inspires you: that lunatic tried to stab my brain 6 times. What did I do with that brain? I went back to school and I graduated with a 4.0 and $90,000 in scholarships. I became a published author and wrote and spoke about my survival throughout Hawaii and California. I knit thousands of scarves, beanies, and potholders and sold them to pay for medical bills. I fought for victim‚Äôs rights, and I supported victims and survivors through their trials. I did all these things with PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and severe chronic pain.

I feel happy, healthy, and satisfied with my life currently. I've never felt better but sometimes I randomly get overwhelmingly sad or have a rush of emotions about an event that happened in the past. I'll get sucked into a memory but it's more centered on the emotions I probably should've felt during the time than the actual event. I refer to them as emotional flashbacks but I'm not sure if that's the correct term or if there's even a term for it. I'll cry and cry. It can be debilitating but then once I'm done crying, it just disappears. I know it's probably repressed trauma I need to work through but I don't know how.

But with PTSD, the burden of proof is usually on us. And often, despite providing overwhelming evidence, it‚Äôs still not always believed that we have it. 

And on top of all of that, the more people do not believe in our symptoms the more we are likely to question them ourselves. Which is almost even more tragic.

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter.

"Update on predator lurking this sub. TW CSA I‚Äôll try keep it short because we had a post like this not too long ago but I‚Äôve got new info I wanted to share. 

There is a person lurking this sub who has gone by previous usernames such as ‚Äúcoder‚Äù and ‚Äúisusha‚Äù. They started by messaging me with something along the lines of ‚Äúhey I saw your post on X and I was hoping I could just vent to you. Awaiting your reply‚Äù 

They say they are a minor being abused. When you engage them they are extremely insistent on NOT calling CPS or the cops. They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. 

I didn‚Äôt report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(
But another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from ‚Äúcoder‚Äù (his old username). 

I think it‚Äôs safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it‚Äôs safe to say they will continue this behavior. 

I‚Äôm sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. 

Stay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps. The younger me would have given this abuser endless empathy and tried to help them/given them the benefit of the doubt that they were a child in need.

"I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile. Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14. Our family had always unusual dynamics, that much was clear, a genre of abuse could be spotted with some time spent around my parents. And not the masks they put on for the guests. Their true, screaming ‚ÄúYOU BRING ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, YOURE DESTROYING THE FAMILY, I WISH I NEVER HAD KIDS, I WISH I WAS DEAD.‚Äù selves.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife. To ask an oblique question I asked my mom, ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you found out Dad was a pedohpile?‚Äù My question was to her but my eyes were on him. 

The shock.

My heart sank.

I gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse. 

‚ÄúDid dad sexually assault you?‚Äù Crawled out of me. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

It was the weakest, most pathetic thing I had ever seen. But it was the truth. I had worn down their defences. I am going no contact with two people now.

"A therapist isn‚Äôt necessarily dismissing your trauma by not giving you a PTSD diagnosis  Several times a week I see a post stating that someone‚Äôs therapist has decided not to give them a diagnosis for PTSD for xyz reason. The conclusion many people come to is that the therapist is dismissing their trauma, they are a bad therapist, or that they are simply uninformed. 

While it is incredibly important to advocate for yourself, we are also not entitled to a diagnosis simply because we think we have it. There are so many differential diagnoses that carry similar symptoms to PTSD and are trauma related disorders that may be a better fit. You may also have gone through a trauma, have symptoms, but not quite meet the criteria for PTSD. 


I urge people to really consider how they feel about their therapist overall and how they respond to their pain when it‚Äôs brought up in session. Recognize a pattern of dismissing and go from there. 

And it‚Äôs worth considering in the comments section that more harm then good can come from telling people whom you don‚Äôt know that their therapist is awful and dismissing them without a fair amount of evidence for it. Because if that‚Äôs not true, the person will carry the belief that yet another person doesn‚Äôt care about them or their trauma. Even if the therapist does care and is still working through the trauma and symptoms of it. 

Of course, advocate for yourself, seek a second opinion if needed. Always be aware if a therapist IS dismissing you. But please recognize a therapist‚Äôs job is to decipher all your symptoms and give you a diagnosis that‚Äôs the best fit.

"Abuse victims with PTSD, have you guys also noticed how abuse is used for comedy in media? It's kinda painful to see what causes me so much heartache used in comic relief. I've mostly seen this with emotional and physical abuse. For example, i remember seeing good luck Charlie as a kid and seeing how neglected Gabe was. He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)
A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.
As a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse.

"""The Body Keeps the Score"" is probably the most comprehensive and easiest to read book on PTSD I've posted about this book before on /r/ptsd , but it helped me so much, I think it bears reposting. The book came out in 2015, so its relatively new. It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.

I have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering.

"My grandmother is dying and I could not care less. Fuck her and that time she tried to kill me. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can‚Äôt think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn‚Äôt have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just grandma being grandma.  Just don‚Äôt think about it.‚Äù

I guess that‚Äôs just what you say when you‚Äôve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn‚Äôt matter. 

It‚Äôs not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn‚Äôt matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don‚Äôt fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that‚Äôs all that matters.

YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!‚Äù  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied ‚Äúfuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think‚Äù

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12‚Äù kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I‚Äôm at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she‚Äôs right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she‚Äôs going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I‚Äôve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.

"I'm a man who was raped by a woman I understand most people don't take this seriously. The first and only time I have ever told anyone else outside of writing it here, I was told ""So, you got laid. Coolio. Good for you! There's no way you didn't like it. She's hot, man, how was it?!"" Had I been a young female, I think my friend's reaction and people's reaction would be different. But because I'm a man, I like sex, apparently.

Anyway, I was in college and starting to deal with my childhood traumas. I opened up to a woman not much older than me for the first time about that stuff. We were in class and tasked with writing a personal story and share it with our partner for feedback with regards to the style of poetry we were told to use. The first red flag should have been when she asked ""Are you **sure** you were abused as a kid?"" When I defended myself gently, she apologized very much and so forth. During our break, we got a coffee and she leaned in to kiss me. I leaned back and apologized, saying that I wasn't comfortable with being intimate with anyone that I wasn't at least a year or more into a relationship, and how I was also the type to save sex for marriage."" ""Sure you are."" She said smiling. She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.

Long story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?"" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like ""I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.""

I'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.

"Think the stigma ever goes away? Think again. Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I‚Äôm not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society‚Äôs view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to at least show some compassion in treatment.

But anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she‚Äôs got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I‚Äôm a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.

Anyways, that‚Äôs why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. 

I was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that could‚Äôve been me? What‚Äôs so funny about that?‚Äù

I could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we‚Äôre still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? 

Sorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I‚Äôm wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy.

"I suddenly understand what that whole ""being relaxed"" thing everyone always talks about is like. It's astonishing what therapy can do when done right. After years and years of holding on to various traumas that manifested themselves in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from excruciating nightmares and panic attacks to hallucinations and psychosomatic heartache, I finally went through an intense process of treatment. I was so skeptical before and during the process(And damn, it was hard), but suddenly, something clicked: I could look back at myself in those memories and feel sad for that girl instead of living in those memories as if they were constantly surrounding me.   
I experienced an intense release of emotion(for quite a while, bless my flatmate's hearts for dealing with me) and my body finally stopped tensing up like it constantly would. I stopped feeling the urge to drink every day. I got my period for the first time in 4 years. I find myself sitting in my room feeling abnormal about finally feeling normal. It's insane.

There's going to be more of us after this pandemic is over, so why not start creating a PTSD inclusive world rather than pretending we don't have a VERY valid illness?

I quickly attained a hatred for men since my father was a huge misogynist, to a point other relatives in misogynistic relationships would say he's a ""misogynistic pig!"".

Then in my teens I was drugged and r*ped with multiple men hearing me yell no, yell for help once. That's when it all clicked... Yet I was drugged and couldn't fight with my strength... I'm devastated in my life by men.

I know that I don't deserve or want this treatment, but I know that my PTSD often takes over, and doubts the ""red flags"" I feel other people would react to, or I allow many more boundary violations than I should. Essentially, I feel as though the ways in which my PTSD has manifested causes me to allow really abusive, manipulative, etc., people into my life whom I wouldn't otherwise give the time of day.

&#x200B;

Does anybody else experience this? It's really started to fuck with my head, and makes me wonder if my roommate's claims (most recent occurrence of this) are true. Especially since he's started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate, since I put boundaries in place and I stopped tolerating his BS. It does make me wonder if i'm just such a fucked up person that I don't even realize I'm fucked up - if that makes sense?",negative,ptsd,2019-07-23 22:56:14
"PTSD is so much more real than I ever knew Holy shit I've never known hell like PTSD. I've always been very supportive and understanding of mental health, but I'm realizing I never truly understood PTSD.

I didn't realize that it just...takes over you. I guess I thought...I'm not sure what I thought. But I didn't imagine that I'd be in a position where I wake up, get triggered by seemingly nothing, then go cry and rock back and forth in a park for 2 hours. Again. 

Its like a force of pure agony hijacks my body until it spits me back out. Its like I'm not even me, I'm not in my body or mind while triggered. I'm something else. Or more accurately, something else is me for the duration. 

Im so sorry to all of you who are also struggling. I'm very educated and I still had not the slightest clue what PTSD truly was. Much love and coregulation to you all",negative,ptsd,2025-05-08 01:56:54
"""Your PTSD can¬¥t be that bad, you have not been to war"" Hello, sorry if this does not fit here, but it is something that has been bothering me for a long time. I am a 20 year old female and have been struggeling with PTSD since my childhood. I feel like I have a problem ometimes talking to people my own age about what has happened to me to mess my brain up this much, because they allways seem to think I am over reacting or making it up. Does anyone else have this problem? I always get responses like ""But you haven¬¥t been to war, you were just in a bad family"" Or"" Your'e to young to have that"" or ""Everyone goes through hard spotts in life, just get over it"" Or "" That is so unbelieveble, No like I litarly can't believe you"" And it really hurt so I just resorted to keeping quiet about it, but the people notice I am weird and just don't hangout with me.

"My therapist revealed his goal was to convince me to reconcile with my abusers So I (26 F) finished breaking up with my therapist/had my last session yesterday.

I already had a small list of reasons that I'd written down, including him feeling the need to explain misogyny to me, his desire to treat my fear of men as my biggest issue, etc etc when I have a lot of trauma from my abusive parents that I wanted to process.

Before I got into all that though, I had some questions to help me going forward. I asked: what IS processing trauma? What does that look like? and what are the steps to take following that to relieve the betrayal I feel?

In the course of answering these questions he kept coming back to one thing: that must talk to the people who wronged me and explain myself and try and mend the relationship. I asked him then, what would be the next steps if I were talking about an abusive ex boyfriend and he STILL said the only path forward was to meet with the ex (in public because SaFeTy Is PaRaMoUnT) and talk it through with them. which I don't even know if I believe, or if he was just refusing to give me an alternate answer.

In the beginning i was VERY clear that my family was abusive and I had cut all contact with them, and that the reason I had issues with past therapists was BECAUSE they wanted me to reconcile. I thought I had been clear enough. Now it's obvious that no matter what I say, they think I can only want estrangement because I am too ill to knoe what's best. That my desire for separation is because of MENTAL ILLNESS.
.I am so hurt and betrayed by this. He fucking lied to me, and I am once again so helpless and feel no therapist will want to help me on my terms: the extent of which are simply ""I refuse to contact my abusers"".",negative,ptsd,2021-09-09 13:31:49

"I called out my abuser in his establishment‚Äôs TripAdvisor comments for what he did to me and all the girls in the group I was traveling with. I feel both empowered and very alone. Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a ‚Äúspiritual healing‚Äù ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that‚Äôs the only reason I can think they didn‚Äôt speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying ‚Äúme too me too!‚Äù Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group‚Äôs leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. 

Flash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he‚Äôs definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group‚Äôs visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. 

So, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I‚Äôm worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. 

It feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can‚Äôt share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.

Edit: Thank you for the support. I have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guy‚Äôs family‚Äôs livelihood and started questioning myself, so your support is really appreciated. I‚Äôm thousands of miles away and relatively anonymous, but I still don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.",negative,ptsd,2019-08-17 11:18:57
"Brainspotting therapy - OMG, try it! (3 Month Update Below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)

I am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy. 

4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn‚Äôt for me). 

So I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score.‚Äù 

But 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn‚Äôt getting it. Feeling it. Just‚Ä¶ nothing. 

I was about to quit yet another form of therapy. 

Then, my EMDR therapist said ‚Äúhey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure.  What is it?‚Äù 

She then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand. 

(This was Telehealth by the way.)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we‚Äôve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know when you feel it,‚Äù she said.  

‚ÄúThis is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust keep your head still and follow with your eyes,‚Äù she calmly said. 

She then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly. 

Nothing. 

Nothing. 

Okay a little something. 

Okay there is pressure in my head. 

Wow, this is getting intense. 

My face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say ‚Äúright there.‚Äù 

I felt it coming to the surface. 

She did the same horizontally across the screen. 

Nothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot. 

After a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger. 

I chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.  

For the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it. 

It was an emotional explosion!  I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it ‚Äúworking it‚Äôs way forward and out!‚Äù 

I cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped. 

My mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered. 

But my brain was now telling me that I hadn‚Äôt processed it yet. 

And now it was time to do that. 

Suddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed  myself partly for his passing - because I wasn‚Äôt there to help him. 

I went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then ‚Ä¶ self forgiveness. 

Actual, real, self forgiveness. 

There really wasn‚Äôt anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply. 

My emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was ‚Ä¶ FIXING THE BURIED! 

And all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK! 

What??????

More was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking. 

And I could just simply FEEL it working. 

I can‚Äôt explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.  

My therapist gently smiled and said ‚ÄúI think we found the modality that works for you.‚Äù 

I cried even more when she said that. 

Because I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy ‚Äúhome,‚Äù at last. 

It was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin. 

I booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)


07/24/22 UPDATE:

Hey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.

I have to say, I‚Äôve felt ‚Ä¶ different. Better, different.

Sessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and ‚Äútrauma work out.‚Äù And last session was ‚Ä¶ no crying.

I was shocked.

So shocked that i said ‚Äúokay, let‚Äôs try EMDR.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I found out what I was doing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with EMDR before and why it wasn‚Äôt working.

She moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions). 

It turns out, EMDR didn‚Äôt work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.

And this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.

So now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can ‚Äúwork out‚Äù still. I won‚Äôt stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing.  And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.

Before, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of ‚Äústimmings,‚Äù extreme agoraphobia where I couldn‚Äôt leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done). 

I still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it‚Äôs about 80% less than it used to be.

So I would call that a HUGE win.

I would be happy to share my therapist‚Äôs info if you are based in NV.  You can DM me. I know how hard it can be to find a good one. But honestly, while she is amazing, this therapy kind of can be done by any trauma trained therapist, just ask them to do it longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist‚Äôs arm.

I feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.

I hope this update inspires some of you who didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù EMDR working or wanted another option.

It does work.

It sounds so new agey. Or bogus.

But man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again.

I hope all of you find the emotional comfort you you deserve.

You are worth it.

You can get better.

The chains can be broken.

Here's to getting ""you"" back and going from surviving to thriving. :)",positive,ptsd,2022-05-03 10:14:03

"Why are people so cruel to those with trauma? Everyone seems to be of the opinion that talking about your trauma or seeking therapy is the healthy way to deal with your trauma. I think to some extent you can find SOME support or validation this way but people don't tell you to brace yourself for the hostility you'll receive when talking about your trauma too.

You'll lose friends when you talk about trauma. Many people are fair weather friends and will abandon you if you are struggling. Others will stigmatize ptsd. Some will be downright bullies and call you a p*ssy or a coward. Others will minimize your trauma and mock you. Yet if you try to keep the conversation light and joke about your trauma, others will get offended by you and say you're trying to be edgy or call you a troll.

It seems like so many people misunderstand where I'm coming from when I do try to talk about it and I don't understand WHY they are so mean. I don't understand why it's even advised to talk about your trauma in the first place if there's so many sick people out there that seem to like to kick people when they're low. Every now and then I'll get a mature conversation with someone on the topic, but I think it makes most people uncomfortable. Sometimes I like to analyze things and I will go over a topic ad nauseam and it doesn't bother me but it seems to enrage other people so they lash out at me and I don't know why? 

Can anyone relate? And what do you do about it? Do you just keep your trauma to yourself? Are you supposed to lie and pretend nothing bad ever happens? What is the goal even supposed to be when people encourage you to talk about your trauma with others if it only seems to upset other people?",negative,ptsd,2022-11-01 14:54:12
"My husband shot himself right next to me. Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been together since we were teenagers. We have two kids together a 4yo and a 2yo, both boys. For the most part, our relationship was great. We were each other‚Äôs first everything. First kiss, first relationship, etc. and I had noticed that this did make us extremely codependent on the other over time. Me and my husband both struggle with mental health problems. My husband more so than me. 

We got married after being together for 6 years and went right into having children. After we had our first son, things started getting really difficult. My husbands mental health began to spiral. The financial burden became fully his because couldn‚Äôt work due to health complications during my pregnancy. We had also decided that it would be more smart for us financially if I stayed home with our son, rather than getting a babysitter. 

Once our oldest became about two years old, I did go back to work to help relieve some stress and we hired my little sister to help with the kids. It helped a lot financially but my husband pretty much checked out mentally with things involving our marriage and being a parent. During the next (roughly) 3 years and one more child later, our relationship became fully platonic. This is something that deeply bothered me and I felt that we needed to fix because we both deserved better. I told my husband about how I was feeling several times and that I wanted to go to marriage counseling but he was firm on not going because he felt they would recommend separation. Which eventually lead to me asking for a separation because I had become so unhappy. 

We had been separated for a couple of weeks and the amount of peace I felt really made me realize that I wanted a divorce. So I told my husband how I was feeling. This did not go very well. He wasn‚Äôt so much angry, as just giving off a very uncomfortable vibe. I decided to take a bath and try to relax from all of the stress, and that is when I received the text. 

It was a suicide text. And he told me that if he couldn‚Äôt be with me that life was not worth living. The time stamp was two minutes earlier so I knew I needed to hurry to get to my bedroom where he had locked himself in. 

I jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, tried to open our bedroom door but it was locked (I didn‚Äôt realize he had locked himself is there at this point). So I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and slide it into the door frame to unlock the door. Once I got into the room, my two year old had followed me and I didn‚Äôt know this because I was focused on helping my husband. He had locked himself in our master bathroom and I couldn‚Äôt get the door open. 

I was shaking the handle, screaming for him, asking what he was doing. He didn‚Äôt answer. I continued to shake the handle and I felt him hold it. And then I heard A loud pop and I heard his body hit the floor. Nothing but a full on wail came out of me. With my two year old right there. I immediately called 911 and grabbed my babies and my sister (she lives with us and heard this from the kitchen) and we waited on the porch, screaming and crying while the police came. 

My husband survived. He lost his right eye and most of his tongue. We do not know what exactly his quality of life will be. But I am grateful he survived. 

I‚Äôm also incredibly traumatized. My two year old screams all of the time now too. I have so many emotions it‚Äôs hard to process. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave me with all of this. Knowing that I would have to grieve and still parent my kids, and still have to figure out how to do all of this while overcoming all of this trauma that he put me through. 

A lot of my family doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. They think that because we had been together for so long that we need to try to work this out. But now I am terrified of him and my decision to get a divorce just feels more solidified. I want no romantic relationship with him. I have nightmares every night. I have to live in the house where my husband shot himself three feet away from me. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm this bitch who is abandoning my husband when he needs me the most. 

I just don‚Äôt know  where to begin with the healing process. I was given a few resources for counseling but I can‚Äôt bring myself to call yet. I guess I just wanted to share my story on here as a way to relieve from sort of stress.

EDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much. The amount of support I am getting from all of you is incredible. My feelings feel validated and that helps me so much more than I can even describe. I am dealing with immense guilt, anger, depression, all while trying to be a good mom to my babies and trying to survive living in this house where I‚Äôm reminded of the entire ordeal every day. I made an appointment for trauma counseling next week. Just talking to the counselor on the phone was already helpful because I felt validation. So I am hoping this is a step in the right direction. Last night was especially hard and I cried for several hours straight just dealing with all of the pain and emotions and confusion. I am going to start the process in going forward with a divorce because like many of you have stated, my instincts are telling me to run. I have nightmares every night that he is shooting himself in front of me, or running around the house with a gun trying to kill me and my boys. I have never in my life experienced trauma like this and I appreciate all of you for being so supportive and understand. This helps more than you know.",negative,ptsd,2022-03-04 11:32:39

"Does anyone else get dreams that isn't about their traumatic event, but have themes of it? TW sexual abuse/ assault description 

If anyone wants more info into what happened to me, you can check my profile.

I've had quite weird and scary dreams these past two nights. The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. 

Then I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) 

The second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'

I began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.

Then a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. 

I'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. 

Can anyone relate to my situation and is this normal?? I feel so ashamed that I'm having such fucked up dreams even though I was never raped, or touched anywhere private without my consent.",negative,ptsd,2020-10-15 21:05:38

"I wish more people spoke about the trauma of being poor Roughly two years ago, I was homeless. I‚Äôm housed now thanks to subsidized housing but still struggling greatly. 

Ptsd puts our mind and body into survival mode, but that‚Äôs extended so much when basic things like food aren‚Äôt a guarantee. 

I‚Äôve talked about it with my therapist. Went over the hierarchy of needs and how often when our most basic needs aren‚Äôt met, we struggle to do anything. 

Doing tasks that aren‚Äôt basic needs for survival become more difficult. It makes sense really. Our survival instinct is we need food to survive. Why would we care about anything else? 

It‚Äôs stressful. It‚Äôs draining. I sit and worry about if we will have food in the fridge in the next few days. I worry if I‚Äôll lose the roof over my head again one day. All I do is worry about it. 

It‚Äôs also draining because often the body isn‚Äôt getting what it needs to function. If you rely on the food bank to feed yourself your meals aren‚Äôt what you need them to be. Things like milk, eggs, meat, fresh veggies and fruits often aren‚Äôt available. You don‚Äôt get enough to make GENUINE home cooked meals.

"I found my mother's dead body I don't usually make posts like this, and I've never used Reddit before, but I just need to get it out. I've never told anyone this before, never allowed myself to really think about it either.

Almost a year ago, my mother died of alcohol poisoning. She had it coming, surprise it didn't happen earlier. I came home from school to find her laying on the couch. Not unusual, I didn't think much of it and went on with my day, thinking she had just fallen asleep there like countless of other times. 

A few hours later when I came out of my room, she was still laying there. I started to worry a bit, but knew it was probably nothing. Came closer (bad idea usually), started looking for signs of life. Nothing. No breathing. No pulse. Wouldn't move when I probed her.

Started to panic real hard, I can't tell you what I was going through at that moment as I was just a mess of ""Ohmygod she's dead she's dead."" I called my sister and she immediately came home. Honestly the next few hours were a blur. My dear sister took care of everything, I was barely there.

Afterwards, I told everyone I was fine. My sister, the social workers, my teachers. But even now, a year later, I can't get over how traumatizing that was. Everytime I come home from school, I get that image in my head of her on the couch. I have to stop myself from throwing up when I even smell alcohol. It haunts my dreams and everyday life.

"I feel ashamed for having PTSD when other people have much more traumatic and understandable causes than mine I know veterans aren‚Äôt the only ones who have PTSD, and I know there are plenty of veterans who probably also feel weak or ashamed or embarrassed for having PTSD. I‚Äôm not a veteran, and I can‚Äôt stop feeling like my reason for having PTSD isn‚Äôt good enough or isn‚Äôt as bad as other people‚Äôs, especially veterans‚Äô. 

I went through almost a year in a relationship filled with emotional and sexual abuse, and now almost half a year of the reporting process with my college that has honestly ended in disaster, with the conduct board blaming me instead of my abuser. I know what I went through was traumatic, I know that PTSD is what I‚Äôm struggling with now, but I feel so weak and ashamed for it. I don‚Äôt mean for this to seem insensitive to anyone, but for some reason I can‚Äôt stop thinking that at least veterans with PTSD (or others who got PTSD from service to others or their country) got it while doing something brave and noble, while I got it from just letting another person have power over me and letting that person make me afraid. 

If I had just been more assertive, maybe he would have stopped. I could have just left ‚Äî I know now all of his implied threats were empty anyways ‚Äî he never would have hurt himself, he was just saying that. 

I only let this happen to protect myself. I have no noble reason for it. I was selfish and dumb and naive, and it really is my fault for letting this happen. There are plenty of people, like veterans and firefighters and EMTs and police officers and doctors and nurses who have PTSD as a result of serving their country and their community, not from being too weak to stand up for themselves like I was. 

On the one hand, I really believe this, that it‚Äôs my fault, that I should have said something, and that other people who have PTSD are so much more worthy of support and admiration because they‚Äôve been through so much more difficult things for better, more noble reasons than me. But on the other hand, I rationally know that that‚Äôs not how this works, or at least I hope it‚Äôs not.

"Technique for intrusive memories I come from Scandinavia. We fish a lot, in wooden boats on the fjords. And the sea is so vast, deep, blue and endless. If we catch a fish you cannot eat, we unhook it and toss it back into the sea. Where it swims away, into the deep.

So, when I try to sleep and intrusive memories pop up. I think ""back into the sea"", catch and release. And I imagine just letting it go and how vast ocean is, and how it is room for it there. Then I actively focus on daydreaming about something cozy and pleasant instead. So that cozy fills my mind. And strangely, this works a lot of the time. While many other things have failed completely.

I'm not sure this will help anyone else. But I just thought I'd mention it.",positive,ptsd,2020-08-25 21:21:55
"My boyfriend nearly died and I can't stop hearing the sound. Earlier today we were out with some friends, chilling and relaxing as one does. We started to mess around with a ball and a bat and eventually I hear this sickening whack and a moan, I look over and my boyfriend is falling over with a bat stuck to his forehead. I launch into a run and my friend and I drag him inside, same friend that hit him, and I call an ambulance. Skip ahead a bit and the last thing I see of him is him shivering with blood all over his face, in his hair, on the ground, just everywhere and It stains my eyelids. He gets dragged into an ambulance and I can't see him anymore, just the frantic shaking as they work inside. I looked down at my hands and one of them was also coated in blood. And I just couldn't. It is  hours later and I have been uncontrollably sobbing for at least an hour and a half. I don't know why I feel the need to share this story but thank you for reading. I am not really looking for support as I know this feeling will probably fade once he recovers. The doctors said his brain scan was fine and he had no broken or fractured bones so that's something. More than anything I am just immeasurably grateful to still have him in my life and this experience has strengthened my love for him 20 times but that deep dreadful feeling when watching someone you love possibly die, it is haunting and that sound will forever be burned into my mind. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this nightmare.

Update: after a few hours of uncontrollable sobbing I eventually passed out while watching over him without even realizing. Thank you for your ideas to help me calm myself. His wound doesn't seem to be any worse after sleeping so I think the healing process is going to be good.

Update 2: Things are looking good, after a lot of talking and being there for each other he is forming thoughts and holding focus better now, he was able to sleep off and on but couldn't fully rest.

"It‚Äôs been 27 years since I was raped by a 20 year old. I was 14. I just told him off. May report. At age 13, a man saw me riding my bike outside and playing with my sister. 

Back story: My sister and I had experienced a lot of trauma already. We were in separate homes. Our parents were dead, and we‚Äôd survived 2 murders. I was in a verbally and emotionally abusive home. All this led me to feeling worthless and unlovable. 

That‚Äôs why he targeted me. 

Over the course of several months, he stopped to talk to me. Got my number. Started calling and slowly built rapport- I now understand this was grooming. After I turned 14, the calling escalated and he drove over to my house to offer yard work. The male figure of my home had recently died so it was just me and the woman raising me. He flattered her. She was old fashioned and thought nothing of a grown man wanting a young girl. 

Once he got approval, the love bombing started. Before long, the sex. I didn‚Äôt even know what to do or how to do it. In short order, his charm eroded. He began controlling me and calling me ugly and worthless. 

By now, I think this is ‚Äúlove‚Äù. He told me it was love. 

My mental health deteriorated and I ended up suicide attempt with a 2 week hospital stay. I also had a venereal disease that had spread very far requiring iv treatment. 

I got out and the sexual and emotional abuse resumed and one of his friends was after my young friend to boot! 
He never took me on a date. Never showed me any gentleness or tender touch.  He brought one of his friends over to meet me. That friend had some sense and told him what he was doing to me was rape. 

He disappeared abruptly. Tried to come back off and on a few times. I told him off. He did the same thing to five other victims of similar age that I know of!

Over the years, my view of love and relationships was warped by what he did to me. I‚Äôve had other traumas since, but trauma has layers like an onion. This is my core wound regarding men. It took me until I was 40 to realize it!

I made a fake Facebook account and I sent his ass a long winded message about how he victimized me and the state it happened in has no statute of limitations on rape of someone the age I was. 

I still have photos of him and I, not nude, but sexual enough that I believe I could finally report him and possibly get justice.

I had to get out of my car while it was moving so I wouldn‚Äôt get hit by the traffic that was about to come & I saw my car literally crash into the ditch across the highway it was terrifying and has haunted me since I was 21.

So I went out on a date the other day with a man in his late 40s. And he picked me up the date was going well because he was saying how pretty I was and how amazing I was at conversation then he starts talking about the therapy he‚Äôs in for his mental health issues. Then I started telling him about my EMDR therapy for my car accident and he looked at me like I was an alien.

I started crying and saying ‚Äú you don‚Äôt understand how crippling this is for my daily life I hate too‚Äù. Then without any emotion he flat out said ‚Äú he wanted a partnership not another job ‚Äú and took me home. I blocked his number and cried my eyes out.

"I grieve the person i was before i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart. I was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them. I was so loud and confident and wasn‚Äôt scared of anything or anyone for that matter. I walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day. I loved waking up in the morning and I loved going to sleep knowing the next day I would be able to enjoy life again. I was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me. I was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out. I always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and I truly feel like that is why I used to enjoy life so much. My siblings loved being around me and I enjoyed their company just as much. Are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward. I would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to. I would laugh at everything especially with my friends. They were the best friends you could ever ask for and I miss them dearly. I miss always being known as the ‚Äúhard working‚Äù person in my friend group. I miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that I would get through it.

PTSD is a biochemical response, and studies have shown that that response is (partially) genetically programmed. Your body's reaction to trauma is not a reflection of your mental strength. Be kind to yourself.

Here's an example of a study linking genetics and biochemistry (specifically of vitamin D) to the development of PTSD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic\_stress\_disorder\_is\_associated\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic_stress_disorder_is_associated_with/)

Let this also serve as a reminder that there are people working endlessly to understand PTSD, and that research will lead better treatments for PTSD. Keep on kicking, it will get better.",positive,ptsd,2021-02-07 00:20:04
"Warning don‚Äôt watch smile 2 I‚Äôve never commented but lurked for a while and im not sure if this would apply to everyone, but from the moment the movie started I was triggered and extremely dissociated by a certain scene in a car I was having a full blown panic attack and ran out of the theater. it lasted quite along time after and I‚Äôm still feeling its affects now(having flashbacks and awful recurring memories). I looked it up on the ride home and the director intended it to ‚Äúfeel like a panic attack from beginning to end‚Äù(I have no idea why anyone would want that but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

"""You're more than your past"" Oh how I hate that phrase. If one more person tells me that I'm ""more than my past"" I'm going to rip my head off. As PTSD is me just fixating on my past rather than a disorder that doesn't allow me to forget. My entire life has been dedicated to trying to forget. From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over.

"ALL medical professionals should be required extensive training on PTSD Just a rant. Its long.

Malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system. PTSD is the malware infecting my system and FEAR is the virus that wrecks havoc.

So I have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being.
I have 3 options

Flee
Freeze¬†
Or Fight¬†

These are the ONLY options fear will give me, suddenly a harmless and simple situation¬† has turned into a battle for my survival. And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus‚Äô own programming.

So I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?

Flee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.


Fight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I‚Äôve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is¬† that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called ‚Äúauthority with good intent‚Äù VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.¬† And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i‚Äôm still aware of what‚Äôs being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I‚Äôm a danger to them when I‚Äôm naked and¬† bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don‚Äôt I have a right to say ‚Äúdon't touch me‚Äù during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I‚Äôm reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories.¬†

Medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be¬† allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of ‚Äúthat just my job.‚Äù yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I‚Äôm going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life.¬†

Freeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.

Every single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person.

EDIT: I didn't expect my post would get as much traction as it did! Thank you for your stories! I feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others, yet before the PTSD sub-reddit I felt so alone and so ashamed. I wish you all safe travels on the path to healing!

P.S Any medical professionals who just have the need to ""educate"" me or anyone else on proper EMS procedure with the intention to exonerate EMS personel...well I cant stop you...but just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears.

P.S.S I'm coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone because...I'm angry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but  I think I have the right to do so in order to express the trauma I received. I believe it's part of my personal healing process.",negative,ptsd,2020-01-09 14:56:06
"I need to talk about my son. NSFW- Child loss & Domestic Violence




When I was 15 I was in a horrible relationship. We're talking daily violence and essentially 4 years of torture both physical and mental. He was 3 years older than me, he was twice my size and I was completely powerless. 

By the time I was 17 I was completely isolated from everyone I love and utterly reliant on him and when I fell pregnant it was just another excuse for him to control every little thing about my life. He had expressed early on that he had no interest in the baby and did not want to be a father. I missed the majority of my prenatal appointments and had to lie to get to any of them, which was an incredibly risky business. 

A few times I took beatings and was convinced I'd lose my baby because they were always focused around my stomach. But my little one held on and was the only thing getting me through it all. I of course wanted to leave but I had nothing and no one, my family and friends had no idea I was even pregnant. 

When I was 37.5 weeks pregnant he drove me towards his work- his work bordered a massive wooded area/conservation park- and when we got to the most secluded part he pushed me out of the car and kicked and kicked and kicked. Every blow landed on my stomach, I tried to protect my baby, not caring how much he hurt me, but eventually I was in a state of semi consciousness and I couldn't control my body anymore. I cannot describe the pain. Like someone had ripped every single one of my organs out one by one, covered them in acid and put them back in. He walked away from me, got back in the car and drove off. That picture of the car driving away, of laying in the road in more pain than I've ever felt is what haunts my nightmares and flashes in front of my eyes every single day. 

I don't remember much after that. An older couple, in their 60s I think found me and took me to the hospital- I'm told they had no phone signal to call for an ambulance. The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling empty. I knew my baby wasn't there anymore but I had no idea where they were. I was frantic, asking where my baby was, if they were alive. I was so upset I'd pulled out all of my IVs and was trying to get out of bed. A doctor came in and told me that my placenta had ruptured, my baby was alive, but he'd been without oxygen for such a long time they didn't expect him to live through the night. 

I was 17 years old, alone having just had major surgery and now been told my child would likely die. The only thing getting me through and he'd be gone too. They brought him in, this tiny little thing covered in wires and tubes. I'd barely even acknowledged the doctor when he told me that my baby was a little boy. None of it was how it was meant to be, but he was here and he was mine and I promised myself I'd do everything possible to help him and protect him.

Alfie wasn't even on my shortlist of names but when the nurse asked me if I had a name for him, it's what came out without hesitation, it felt right. That nurse sat with me for hours, even after her shift ended so I wasn't alone. We are still friends to this day. I was allowed to hold him with the help of some pillows so I didn't rip my stitches and he wrapped his tiny hand around my finger. The doctor came back regularly to check on him and it was clear even to me that he was deteriorating. I asked them to stop my pain medication so I could remember him more clearly, so I wouldn't forget a single second. They were reluctant but agreed and I held my son for 44 hours and 13 minutes until he took his final breath. 

I'm sure I was screaming, but all I could hear was my ears ringing and I just held him and cried for hours, until they told me they had to take him away. I've never known emptiness like it. My arms were empty, my heart was empty and my stomach was empty. It still feels like someone reached their first into my chest and ripped out my heart, even 8 years later. 

Most of my family and friends still don't even know about Alfie. I can't talk about him out loud. I can't answer their questions and watch their hearts break as well as my own. My amazing best friend knows as does my SO and they're both incredible when the world gets too much. 

Alfie's father is in prison, for the things he did to me and subsequently his now ex-wife and going to court was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I did it for my son, to get him justice, even though it will never bring him back to me. 

If you're still reading, thank you. I'm glad you met Alfie with me. He was born at 11:11 in the morning. So if you happen to catch it on the clock, make a wish on us both.

"Do not let the ‚Äúfalse memory research‚Äù of Elizabeth Loftus stop you from speaking up for yourself and other survivors Sometimes as a survivor of childhood incest (perpetrated by my ex-father) I have doubted myself for not remembering every detail that I would have remembered more as an adult. 

But I viscerally remember being a child lying in fear at night in my bed, hiding underneath my blanket, listening to every sound in the house, every footstep, hoping my ex-father wouldn‚Äôt cross the hallway to attack me. He never allowed me or my sister to lock our bedroom doors. It was almost always dark and the injuries he inflicted were internal, painful and shameful. I focused on the wall. I pretended I wasn‚Äôt there, that I was a bird, flying away. I tried to ignore, as much as possible, how my own body was betraying me. 

After family court removed him from my childhood home, I tried my best to move on. I was non-compliant with therapy. I buried the pain until they come up again when I had my first romantic relationships in college. 

But throughout my long healing journey, I have repeatedly encountered the memory research published by Elizabeth Loftus. She has used her status as a distinguished law and psychology professor to repeatedly argue adults who recall buried (‚Äúrepressed‚Äù) memories of childhood incest and sexual abuse must be ‚Äúfaking‚Äù their memories. She has used her ‚Äúlost in the mail‚Äù university psychology experiment to cast doubt on survivors‚Äô testimony, and trains other defense lawyers how to do so. She sat on the scientific advisory board of the now disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation. 

But I have suffered too much lifelong insomnia, nightmares, night terrors, shivers, involuntary flashbacks, fearful freezing (and other repetition compulsion behaviors including promiscuity and willingness to engage in sex work) to allow her stature in the memory research community to stop me from speaking up for myself and others. 

Today, I learned she has testified for the defense  at the trials of: Harvey Weinstein, Ghislaine Maxwell (associate of Jeffrey Epstein), Robert Durst, among many other high-profile defendants who were ultimately convicted of sexual assault or murder. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#Involvement_in_legal_cases

"People telling me ‚ÄúYour trauma doesn‚Äôt define you‚Äù really bothers me My trauma literally goes back farther than my earliest memories and I have trauma from both my parents, my sibling, my extended family, school, church, from ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and from my workplaces.

After that bastard is out of your life, you see someone on The Price Is Right named George. He is not the George who abused you. Would hearing that name bring you back to the time you were tortured by George your ex?

I was raped in 2017 and I was diagnosed with PTSD in March. Hard to tell how long it‚Äôs been going on - this past few years have been extremely hard on my mental health. 

I decided on my own accord to report my rapist to the police after a lot of therapy and pondering. I‚Äôm going to the station tomorrow. I was fine, happy, motivated. Now I‚Äôm a freaking mess. 

I will go, that‚Äôs out the question. I guess I just want some support from someone. I‚Äôm very scared. I feel tiny and ridiculous.

"having to grow up too fast due to trauma damaged me i used to love when people told me i acted mature for my age. i was always seen as a kid with lots of potencial and very intelligent. this was all due to having to ""grow up"" too fast because of being traumatized since i was 3 years old and developing anxiety disorders. i was a child worried about life and existence, and very very scared. i had toys but i wasn't the typical child who always wanted to have more and more toys, simply because that didn't matter that much. all i wanted was to feel normal.
since i always felt like i had to act older than i was, now that im 18, i feel like crying because i didn't actually get anything from being very ""mature"" for my age. it's all loneliness and regret for wasting my potential, because even tho i really was creative and smart i never had the energy to actually use that potential because i was just so damaged. i just lost my childhood and now at 18 with all this isolation from covid i am starting to realize that i want to be a happy child for just one day. i want to be taken care of and loved instead of yelled at. i don't want to have panic attacks or phobias, or responsibilities etc. i simply want to be a happy kid with no fears just for one day. i want to know what that is like. i hate being a grown up. i feel like that's all I've ever been and I'm exhausted.",negative,ptsd,2020-12-02 02:08:49

Of course, when I eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything, but it's better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me.

"Recent trauma due to wife's child birth  TW >!post partum psychosis!<

Hi all. Looking for some advice. My wife gave birth to our first child (a healthy and beautiful baby boy) and then unfortunately suffered a massive psychotic episode that has since been diagnosed as post partum psychosis. I was there by her side for almost the entire thing. The delusions, paranoia, chaotic thoughts along with the manic levels of energy were brutal to watch. And I honestly thought it couldn't get worse until she grabbed my shirt so tight I could barely breath and ended up biting my chin so hard I thought at the time I was losing my face. Thankfully we were at the hospital still when this happened and they were able to get us separated before any significant physical damage was done. 

It was 12 hours long and the bite was three seconds although it feels much longer. Currently I'm at home with a five day old baby, a dog, and a wife who will hopefully be transferred to a psych hospital tomorrow or Monday. This happened two days ago and I have no clue how to move forward except feed my baby and keep him clean. Has anyone else experienced something similar or know of any resources? I am talking to therapists next week but my fears right now are consuming me. 

Thanks so much for any advice, support, whatever.",positive,ptsd,2024-08-11 05:50:19
"I almost had a panic attack in class BUT I DIDN'T!!!! My math professor is upset because only half the class showed up. She's taking it out on the students who did show up. Yelling/voice raising is really triggering for my PTSD, and it **skyrocketed**. I started disassociating, but I did 4-7-8 breathing. As I breathed in and held my breath I clenched my fists, and as I breathed out I released my fists. Ended up not having a panic attack and not disassociating!!!!

"PTSD just saved my life. I work in the city writing property damage estimates. There were power lines hanging real low to the street, so I was already pretty Hyper-vigilant. While I'm working, a large box truck drove by and knocked down the power lines. I jumped out of the way immediately because the sound of the truck hitting the wires put me into fight or flight instantly. And then the lines fell on top of where I was standing.

A part of me wishes it killed me, but now I've had an epiphany that I do not want to die being so afraid all the time. If that killed me today, I would have never conquered my demons.",negative,ptsd,2022-05-19 13:50:27

"In an important step toward medical approval, MDMA, the illegal drug popularly known as Ecstasy or Molly, was shown to bring relief to those suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder when paired with talk therapy. ‚ÄúThis is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,‚Äù said Dolen  [MDMA Reaches Next Step Toward Approval for Treatment - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/mdma-approval.html) 

Of the 90 people who took part in the new study, which is expected to be published later this month in Nature Medicine, **those who received MDMA during therapy** **experienced a significantly greater reduction in the severity of their symptoms** compared with those who received therapy and an inactive placebo. ***Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.***

**MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects. Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite.**

Once I sent her the link, she texted me immediately swearing at me saying F words.

I hear her go to her mom, I think she is complaining about my message I sent her. Next, her mom comes to my room to talk to me. Then my daughter comes to my room swearing at me . Calling me fucking idiot . Fuck u . Etc. 

Next thing I know she became fully possessed by devil. collapsed to the floor , yelling at the top of her lungs, crying, swearing, kicking walls.

Further proof,

My religious, idiot father sent me a text message of Jesus dying on the cross . A very graphic one with the look of torture on his face and blood dripping all over his head and body. 

I immediately text him..
‚ÄúWhat the fuck ! Why are you sending me graphic images for !!! I‚Äôm blocking you! I‚Äôm not even Christian for fucks sake! ‚Äú 

As I‚Äôm in the process of blocking him, he sends me that picture AGAIN.

I show my mom, she goes to his room to talk to him.

I walk pass by raising my voice ..‚Äù stop sending me that shit! Do you think I want to see blood like that ?! Do you think I want to see blood like ?!!!!! U fucking idiot ! U think I don‚Äôt remember ?!! I remember every-fucking-day !!! Fuck u !!! ‚Äú

Next thing,  I‚Äôm collapsed on the floor having a full blown panic attack . It lasts almost 30 mins. I couldn‚Äôt get up, so I crawled to my room to look for a bottle of Ativan. Took 1 to calm down.

After, I looked in the mirror, the blood vessels burst around the skin of my eyes, temples &amp;amp; on my forehead.

"Infantilization of sexual assault victims? Trigger warning for mentions (not descriptions) of assault I‚Äôm curious about whether other people have experienced this, or feel that it‚Äôs annoying in any way.  
It seems to me that there‚Äôs a very particular way we talk about victims of sexual assault, and that it‚Äôs different from the way we talk about other people who have developed ptsd.  
For example: I recently got invited to a virtual event for survivors of sexual assault where we are supposed to write love letters to our former selves.  It‚Äôs all very ‚Äúglitter and craft scissors‚Äù.  
Even the metaphors used to talk about us are often full of things like butterflies and flowers blooming after a forest fire.  Very saccharine and childish.  
And when I was looking for resources about sexual recovery after trauma, everything I found was focused on gentle, romantic, candles-and-soft-music sex.  There seemed to be no general understanding that some people looking for sexual recovery might just want to, excuse my language, have fun and fuck.  I found it all very flowery and unhelpful.  
I guess I feel like it‚Äôs dehumanizing.  Like it ties in with the way we expect women to be sweet and innocent and pretty, and so when something ugly and real happens to us it‚Äôs got to be buried in sunshine and sugar.  I would far rather we just be seen as grubby little humans like everyone else.  
Am I alone in this?  I don‚Äôt see military PTSD getting the same treatment (nobody is asking veterans to sit down with glitter and craft scissors to write love letters to their former selves).  I mean no offence at all to anyone who prefers this kind of language, and I‚Äôm so happy for anyone who is helped by it.  But I find it a tad insulting.",negative,ptsd,2021-04-09 18:35:55

Another example is when you see the abuse happen, the dude tells her to cut her ears off cause she wouldn‚Äôt listen and then when she actually goes to cut her ear off he tells her not to and that he loves her.

"Trauma Is Like A Mold This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. 

Trauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won‚Äôt have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. 

The thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won‚Äôt be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. 

Trauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they‚Äôre in a better place in their lives. It‚Äôs inconvenient and most people want to wait until they‚Äôre done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it‚Äôs fine and they can look at it later when they‚Äôre more ready. 

When you come back to look at trauma later, it won‚Äôt be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.

Shame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say ‚ÄúI wish I dealt with this 20 years ago‚Äù. 

The way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open.

"My manager choked me yesterday. TW: physical assault 

For context I have been diagnosed with PTSD for years due to a couple different traumas. 

If it matters, I am female. Yesterday my boss and I were laughing about something, we joke around a lot but up until now he has never laid hands on me. He was about a foot away from me and he abruptly reached out and wrapped both his hands around my neck, squeezed and shook me. He was laughing and didn‚Äôt do it as a serious attack, but nonetheless he fully wrapped his fingers around my throat and choked me. He let go after a few seconds and was still laughing after and I was so shocked that I just nervously laughed and got away from him as soon as possible. It was not a light choke, after he did that I was sore for an hour after. 

I called his boss crying and in shock. Long story short she was PISSED and brought it to HR immediately. I was informed by her today that HR is still deciding what to do - aka, he has not been fired yet. In the meantime he is not working on Monday and I‚Äôm reporting to his boss as my manager until something is decided. 

It didn‚Äôt sink in until after I got away from him and had a moment alone just how messed up it was. I already have PTSD from several traumas and yesterday just keeps replaying in my mind over and over, I‚Äôm worried this will just be another trauma to add to the list. If he isn‚Äôt fired I‚Äôm going to be seriously scared for my safety because this is not the first time I‚Äôve reported him for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. They are still investigating and I‚Äôve already decided that I am quitting if he is not fired. I love my job, I work in the mental health field and I deeply care for the people I support. But I refuse to feel in physical danger from my coworkers at work. 

I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about yesterday and I could use some kind words right now. :(

**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your advice. I talked to my former divorce attorney asking for recommendations for any of her colleagues who can help me if he is not fired. She was absolutely floored when I told her what happened and told me to contact her after work tomorrow so she can find representation for me if he is not fired. She said it would really be best if I have an attorney with me when I talk to HR but given that this is happening tomorrow there‚Äôs no time for that, so she advised me to record any and all interactions I have with management or HR regarding the situation and to act very carefully. In the meantime I‚Äôm taking care of myself and emotionally preparing for tomorrow.

**Edit 2:** I found out today that he has been fired. I am still shaken up but I am relieved knowing that I won‚Äôt have to face him again or feel unsafe/uncomfortable at work. I did notice bruising and swelling today and took pics which I sent to HR and I am sure that played a part in their decision as well. I‚Äôm seeing my doctor tomorrow and seeing what she recommends to make sure that I‚Äôm 100% okay. Thank you so much everyone for your support, I greatly appreciate this sub. üíô",positive,ptsd,2021-07-31 22:16:03

"I wish someone would've told me how healing running my own businesses could be... Instead everyone discouraged me because of my PTSD! + more thoughts on jobs and managing PTSD **EDIT:** Ahhh omg! My first Reddit award ü•∫!! After I posted this I had the usual PTSD self-doubt, worrying that y'all wouldn't understand, but of course YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN ANYONE!! I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)

&#x200B;

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.

A couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.

As I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(

I faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that ""making it"" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.

I paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of ""experts"" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your ""true"" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).

Why do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of ""study"" yourself.

I did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**

Anytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.

Am I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.

BUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.

I could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.

I'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts. Thanks for listening, I love lurking this sub and this is my first post :)",positive,ptsd,2020-07-24 01:25:05

"Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse? Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?

I stopped dressing feminine, wore baggy clothes, channeled my masculine energy to scare/intimidate men so I don‚Äôt get sexual attention. Yeah, I did this. And also when I was covertly sexually abused by my dad, instead of protecting me, my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldn‚Äôt let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised. I looked unkempt growing up.

And now at 27 that I know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse I went through... I have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men. Also, when I have flirted in the past, I realize I behaved like a little girl. So now I‚Äôm grossed out that men were attracted to me when I acted like a little girl, does that mean they have pedophile tendencies?

Also, I‚Äôm really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted. Like I only can be around men who exhibit feminine/passive energy right now and I get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled. Controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history. Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim. You would think I would be more scared around those types of men But I still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because I can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy.

I am grossed out by men and don‚Äôt trust them‚Äîtoo many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you. If I had a daughter I‚Äôd be so protective. It‚Äôs a scary world out there.

"I often associate living with a disability to playing a videogame. When you're a gamer, in that ""sphere"" there are always going to be people who **penalize you for preferring to play the game on Easy Mode** so that you can *enjoy* playing, instead of Hardcore Insanity Mode just to **""prove"" that you're ""stronger and tougher""** than everyone else. 

I love playing video games. I have a brain injury and I am bad at playing them. **The only way I get to** *enjoy* **playing games**, is by **playing them on Easy Mode with accessibility options enabled**. And that's how my life has to look, too, and there are always going to be people who tell me I'm **""cheating"" at life or ""taking shortcuts""** instead of taking steps to **enable my life to be enjoyable to me**.

And ultimately, when you drill down to what these people are really saying, these are people who believe that **life shouldn't be enjoyable.** These are people who don't prioritize enjoyment, hobbies, happiness, and wellbeing for themselves and so they certainly don't accept you prioritizing that for yourself. 

I've already been through enough combat. Enough violence. Enough heartbreak and literal, legal torture. The accommodations that we need as human beings with a pervasive *disorder of stress*, is to do our best to minimize the amount of stress we experience on a daily basis.

I don‚Äôt take pride in my trauma or PTSD, but I hate that, because tons of people are jumping on the bandwagon, it makes it seem that my actual PTSD which I earned the old fashioned way (by experiencing a traumatic event that was listed in the DSM-V) is just ‚Äòa trend‚Äô and not real, substantial and horrific.

I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt believe it. There was no autopsy because my dad doesn‚Äôt want to know if he could‚Äôve done something. He‚Äôs been a wreck. I have told him about these flashes and he said it was my ptsd.

"Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner If you‚Äôre a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù I recall reading a book called ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy My Love‚Äù that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I‚Äôm sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn‚Äôt how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù or ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I‚Äôve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away.

"For everyone who manages their depression with exercise‚ÄîI compiled a comprehensive list of simple bodyweight exercises to do if we have to quarantine and the gyms get shut down again. If you're anything like me, you've managed your depression with exercise for awhile and once the gyms closed down last year, it really messed everything up. Personally, I fell back into a deep depression (it was as if I suddenly stopped taking antidepressants!), turned to food and alcohol for comfort, gained 60lbs and did virtually no exercise since the gyms were closed, and didn't even know where to start other than jogging and simple things like squats.

That's why I created a full document of bodyweight exercises that require little or no equipment to help keep us all from backsliding harder if/when we have to quarantine again. Most of them can be effective even if done just a few minutes a day in your bedroom (for those of us who have trouble getting out of bed on those bad days). And I'm sure we all know how sore and stiff our muscles feel when we spend all day laying around.

This list is complete with Cardio, Bodyweight exercises, Mobility, and Stretching. I referenced videos on all of the things I figured most laypeople might not know about. I also included links for the optional equipment for both Amazon and Non-Amazon resources.

If you have any suggestions on anything else to add, I'll gladly keep building on the list! I know a lot of us use exercise to manage depression and when we can't, it becomes a vicious cycle of not having motivation to exercise and then not having any serotonin because you didn't exercise lol

I hope this helps at least a few of you. Let's adapt and conquer this time around, friends. Remember, even a few minutes helps!

edit: Just thought of another thing I didn't add to the list! For cardio, you can play basketball or dance! Basketballs can be cheap, and lots of outdoor parks have a hoop and dancing, well, you can dance anywhere and to anything :)",positive,ptsd,2021-08-05 17:30:34
"Anyone else‚Äôs partner left them after revealing their trauma? My boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me the other night after I told him that I ran into the man who sexually abused me throughout my childhood when I went to visit my hometown. I didn‚Äôt ask for comfort, I just wanted to be transparent and texted to let him know what happened and how I was feeling. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to do anything or say anything, but that it was really jarring seeing the man again after so many years. I‚Äôve actively been in therapy and been taking medication for the last 2.5 years. I‚Äôve told him about my trauma before and what happened - he was aware. 

He told me that hearing about this run-in made him realize that if we become more serious or get married in the future, that my trauma would ‚Äúbecome [his] problem,‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbe a part of that.‚Äù 

I asked for so little from him. He had been upset that I don‚Äôt open up to him as much literally the week before so I tried to open up and let him in, and he broke up with me over it. 

I feel so helpless. I can‚Äôt control what happened to me, and he basically just left because of the trauma. If it was currently affecting the relationship or if I was mentally in a bad place or not seeking treatment, I could have understand- but it feels he left me purely over the fact that it happened to me and is a part of my life story. I feel so disgusted with myself. I just wish all over again that the abuse didn‚Äôt happen to me.

"I'm about done with EMDR, and I've come to a realization with my PTSD. I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood. 

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've  been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go. 

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

It's a bittersweet truth, but I've made some progress. I used to actively hurt myself because I was so used to others hurting me and telling me I was not good enough. I don't do that anymore.",negative,ptsd,2021-02-10 17:12:38

I won‚Äôt get into detail but what I mean is say someone does something that triggers your PTSD, and then you continue interacting with them.

Does anyone else have this happen to them?

"Does anyone else feel like they overcame their PTSD, and then just have a meltdown/episode/panic attack out of nowhere?

The next day I would usually feel fine and even enlightened, and I would write down some new insights about myself or the world. I would feel like I've finally overcome my PTSD and that I won't breakdown again. Then a few weeks later I would have one negative thought, then talk it out with my husband, and next thing I know, I'm having panic attacks again.

My boyfriend and I have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this. Most times I have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so I act like nothings wrong but he knows. Today before we had sex we talked about it. We discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and I told him everything I could think of that made me uncomfortable and I had the best sex of my life. It's a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and I am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear. Normally I dont tell him during sex if I'm triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways. Today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us. No ptsd.

"I'm 24. Two years ago my girlfriend (soon to be finance) and I wrecked and she passed. I suffered severe injuries and still haven't recovered and the PTSD from this night stops me from doing anything. I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty and I feel remorse and I just feel awful everyday. Ever since this accident happened my life has gone downhill. I dropped out of college in my last semester, moved in with my parents, and haven't done anything since. I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since. I can't stop taking them and I don't even want to but they're my only way to cope. I just feel hopeless and have no idea what to do. That one night ruined my entire life and I feel like she's the lucky one. 

She was just completely smashed when the car flipped and my bottom half of my body was as well. The images from this night are in my head at all times and I revisit this accident probably a dozen times a day. If something reminds me of this night then I just shutdown and try to get to the ground so I can curl up, plug my ears, and let it pass. It's happened in restaurants and I can't cope with it. I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare. One time the song that was playing when we wrecked came on randomly and I fell to the ground and essentially blacked out like I was having a seizure. I don't know how I can stop this from happening at this point. It's been two years and it seems like they're getting worse. 

We weren't even that drunk and because of a stupid fucking mistake she's gone and my life is miserable. We made this mistake and paid a cost beyond belief and I don't know how what we did was justifiable of these reprocussions. We had wine is all, with dinner.

"I realised today that I like myself! For the first time, in.. well, ever.

I'm not sure exactly what changed or when. But today, after I did something dumb (I don't remember what, something insignificant like walking into the door frame), the inner monologue said something like 'it's okay, I like myself'. 

It stopped me in my tracks - I don't remember ever thinking that before. I took a moment to look in the mirror and see myself from a positive, more objective perspective; not just in my appearance, but in the person I am.

And I am here to tell you, kids, that I saw it all, and I liked it. I didn't see some dumb, fat, dropout loser like my brain tries to portray me as. 

Instead I saw beauty. I saw a compassionate, weird, creative, fierce woman, who suffered trauma upon trauma but somehow overcame. Who even in the lowest points of her own life has never turned away a person in need. Who continues to grow and evolve into better versions of herself every day.

I'm telling you this partly because I'm proud of myself and wanna show off a little, but mostly because I want anyone and everyone out there who's struggling with themselves, to know that it's possible. It's not just something people say to make you feel better; it's real and it's attainable.

"Does anyone else have a bit of a staring problem (hypervigilance) that was developed due to PTSD when around people/crowds?

My eyes follow and observe people like a hawk  so I stay ""safe"" and avoid such people who I feel will hurt me again(which in my case translates to everyone). But the thing is I believe everyone is a threat, so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control. As if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what I can control in the present time. The thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life.

"Therapist says I don't have PTSD because you can only get it from SA or threat of death. What the title says. I think I need to switch therapists. She is good in a lot of ways but tells me that I merely self diagnosed myself with PTSD and that it is not possible for me to have it unless I was sexually assaulted or was threatened with death. She doubts a diagnosis of PTSD I received from a psychiatrist. Even after I tell her about my flashbacks, nightmares, hyperarousal and everything else, she continues to reiterate that I need to stop self diagnosing myself. I don't know how to feel because when she says this to me it makes me feel uneasy but I have no idea if she's telling me the right thing or not. She does EMDR and specializes in trauma therapy so I'm just not sure why she seems to completely disregard all of my symptoms..

Edit: just to be clear I'm not mad solely about the fact she's not agreeing about me having PTSD. It's because I think it's infinitely helpful to say I have PTSD because it encompasses all of the confusing symptoms that I didn't quite know how to explain before. Part of it feels like she just doesn't believe that I'm telling the truth. I think she's a little bitter because everything she tries to tell me is something I already know. I told her about my misophonia and she didn't even know what it was. Then she proceeded to cutely say ""Oh I think I have that too! I can't stand people chewing!"" I just sit there kind of in awe at not only how irrelevant that is but how invalidating it seemed. Nobody likes the noise of chewing.

"My fucking fault. Two years ago I got raped by the girl I was dating. She was 23 and I was 18. In her car, she pressured me into letting her ride me without a condom. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable but I went along with it like a dumb ass. She would ride me and then I‚Äôd be like stop and then she‚Äôd stop and then I‚Äôd be like okay and then the cycle would continue for a while. However, at one point I told her to stop and she told me no. I disassociated completely. No response no movement nothing. I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôd as a child as well so when it happened to me at 18 I was a child again I guess I don‚Äôt fucking know. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

It‚Äôs important to know that I stayed in the relationship and continued to have unprotected sex. Why didn‚Äôt I leave?.. I don‚Äôt know. I ask myself every day. I blame myself every day. 

That being said, the girl who raped me (ex gf) had told me that she had been single for two years so I had no problem having raw sex with her as I figured because she was older she was taking care of herself. 

However, I recently talked to my friend who had introduced me to my ex and was close friends with her. I forgot how we got to it and I told her ‚Äúwell she told me she had been single for two years‚Äù and she then told me that was a lie and that she had actually just had a pregnancy scare before she started having sex with me. 

I immediately went to get STD tested and I found out today I have chlamydia. I feel so fucking dehumanized. I feel so fucking stupid. I feel so traumatized and hurt and I‚Äôm honestly considering suicide. Yes I can go pick up meds and it‚Äôll be gone but it‚Äôs so much deeper than that, especially now. 

I currently have a gf and plan to tell her. I‚Äôm expecting her to leave me though because I‚Äôve put her, albeit unknowingly, in danger. Her and I have only had sex unprotected one time but I still want to tell her. I love my gf and want to propose but it doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôll happen now. 

Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

I hate myself so fucking much. 

Update: my gf is mad at me. Not saying too much of anything. She said nevermind when beginning to speak, I asked her to talk to me, she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù she says, ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt think you do‚Äù so.. yeah. 

Update 2: she‚Äôs mad because when we first got tg she asked if I was clean, I told her yes. At the time I genuinely believed I was clean. It was not meant to be deceitful. I had and still have no symptoms so I had no reason to believe otherwise. 

Update update: She told me she loves me but couldn‚Äôt stay on the phone due to being upset. 

Update 3: gf called 3 times last night. I didn‚Äôt answer. I‚Äôm not upset with her I just can‚Äôt talk to her right now or anybody for that matter. I have hardly slept. In three maybe 4 days I‚Äôve gotten 2-4 hours of sleep. 

The nightmares are more frequent so that‚Äôs wonderful and I feel alone. 

Thank you all for the love and support that is being given it means the world to me especially right now. 

Another update: after this is all settled I think I‚Äôm going to break up with her. I can‚Äôt forgive my self for this and I don‚Äôt believe I ever will. She deserves to be happy. Nothing will be the same with her and I and I think I can live with that. I think my last act of love will be letting go. I hurt her so badly. I love her so much. I can‚Äôt forgive myself. 

Next update: I‚Äôve started cutting off friends. Where I‚Äôm at I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve good things or good people. I think they‚Äôll be better off without me. I know it makes no sense but I truly believe I am a monster. 

I just wrote my suicide note. Don‚Äôt know when exactly but I‚Äôll be gone soon. My mind is made and I‚Äôm at peace. I can‚Äôt really live with any of the guilt that I feel nor can I live with what has happened to me any longer. I thank you all for the kind words but I will be gone soon (God willing). 

Last update: I‚Äôm kinda at the end of my rope with everything. I‚Äôm withdrawing from a lot of my friends and my girlfriend especially. I don‚Äôt call her or text her. I feel like she‚Äôd just be better off w/o me at this point.  

Been doing a lot of reflecting and thinking back to when me and my gf last spoke. 

When she said she asked me if I was clean (in april) and I told her I thought I was she said to me, ‚Äúyou thought a lot of things.‚Äù She also asked me why would I think she (my ex) was clean after she has already violated me and I told her I thought she (my ex again) loved me. 

A lot of my life is up for debate rn. 

I‚Äôm having a lot of issues trusting her currently. I‚Äôm not really sure I can anymore. Idk I‚Äôm overreacting. 

After much more reflection, I lied to her. Like it or not I should have went to get tested but I didn‚Äôt and told her I was clean just because I had no symptoms of anything. 

Last thing: I desperately want to talk to my gf but I honestly cannot. Knowing I‚Äôve hurt her so badly and being essentially re traumatized by all this I‚Äôm not in a good place. I‚Äôe hardly slept and because I‚Äôve bp.. yeah. It‚Äôs grim. 

So, me and my gf have finally talked everything out. Yesterday morning she told me that she wasn‚Äôt necessarily mad about the whole sti thing and whatnot but rather my distance and absence.  She validated my hurt but also let me know that she had a lot going on and she felt alone too. I took ownership and accountability because while I am hurting she‚Äôs still my partner and if I needed space I could have communicated that. She‚Äôs not a mind reader. 

Last night I told her that I feel horrible about everything and I apologized again. She told me, and I quote, ‚ÄúYou never asked to be in this situation. I know you would never intentionally put me in this sort of situation. I know you and I know your heart and that‚Äôs what matters.‚Äù I almost cried. 

I find it so strange how she can forgive me in spite of my inability to forgive my self. I have found a therapist and have an appointment today at 5:30.

"Never thought I‚Äôd be bothered by people using PTSD inaccurately This is a rant‚Ä¶ I know people do it all the time to describe something that was mildly traumatizing and say they now they have PTSD. Similar to how people will joke about having OCD or being bipolar even though they‚Äôre not.

 I never thought I‚Äôd be bothered by it that much until this morning when I saw a tweet of someone saying how they think they have PTSD from having friendships where they were too much of the ‚Äúnice friend‚Äù. And it got all these retweets and replies from people relating to it because they‚Äôve had similar experiences of being wronged by friends. And it rubbed me the wrong way. That people get to say shit like they have PTSD when they really don‚Äôt. It rubbed me the wrong way, After spending a sleepless night crying and screaming having to have my husband cradle and console me all night because of the flashbacks. Wanting for it to stop and having no solution except wanting to rip the skin off my body. Hearing my husband say ‚Äúit will pass‚Äù over and over and trying desperately to believe him and knowing it will but it doesn‚Äôt help make the pain any unbearable.

I know it‚Äôs not that serious but seeing that tweet pissed me off. I wanted to reply to that tweet and ask them, oh did you spend all night screaming and crying and feeling like you were being r*ped and assaulted? Do you have trouble living a normal life because you are constantly reminded and debilitated by this trauma? Having trauma is one thing and having PTSD is another.

"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf! A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!

So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.

First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.

Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! 

 They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! 

He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.

Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.

He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!

How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.

"I ate Crunch Berries. TW: Child Abuse (but no detailed descriptions) 

I was severely abused by my father as a child. I haven't had any contact since I'm 8 years old. One odd memory that always stood out to me was how he'd eat Captain Crunch every single morning. Out of a white mixing bowl with a serving spoon. I remember being really little and watching him do it and I swore off ever trying Captain Crunch (or any variety of it). (I wasn't allowed to eat ""his food"" back then so never tried it with him.) I didn't want to be anything like him or have anything in common, down to his taste in cereal. 

It also happens to be one of my husband's favorite cereals but when we started dating I explained why I don't eat it and he stopped eating it too. The other day he called from the store and said they had a version of just the berries that looked like stars and were only red, white, and blue. It would taste the same but look completely different. I told him he could get it and that maybe I'd even try it. I did. It's delicious. It kind of tastes like Trix. I told him that maybe when this box runs out I'd try regular Crunch Berries and that I'd like to work my way up to actual Captain Crunch. 

I'm not like my father because I ate Crunch Berries. I'm like my husband. And my son (I'm 24 weeks pregnant currently!) will probably like it one day too. And I also found out my sister has tried and loves it. It's just a good cereal and I'm glad my brain has finally realized it doesn't have anything to do with that monster.  

This probably sounds incredibly stupid to someone who doesn't have PTSD, so I figured this was a good place to share my small victory.",positive,ptsd,2023-06-27 13:28:41

"[TW (Child) SA] It did not happen for a reason. I am sick and tired of this phrasing. 

I've seen this a lot all over reddit when talking about trauma, especially when religious people enter the conversation: ""Everything happens for a reason.""

I refuse to believe that there is any reason in this world for a child to be r*ped repeatedly over multiple years. I refuse to believe that my suffering had a purpose and it therefore was a bit of a good thing. 

I was not. It did not have a purpose. Bad things happen to people who don't deserve it for no reason and I can live with that. And don't come with the whole ""Your trauma made you strong"" nonsense. 
Yes, maybe it did make me strong retrospectively, but before that it made me miserable, hurt, scared, ashamed and broken during a time where I deserved to be carefree and happy. I would want these people to look at a picture of three-year-old me and tell that little girl: ""What is happening to you right now has a purpose and it's how things are supposed to be"".
See if they still have the guts to do it then. 

I should add that I have had a great therapist and managed to overcome major CPTSD within a year after delayed post-amnesial onset. I am doing extemely well in my day to day life and I am currently pursuing my dreams without major setbacks. 

But hell, I am allowed to be angry and sad that this had to happen to me. I don't have to go to Church to understand why it did, I was abused because there are some terrible people in this world and it's not always possible to recognize them at first glance.

"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!*"" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3

"Anyone else have trauma resulting from inpatient mental hospital stays? Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).

In August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a ""manic episode"". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ""wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs"", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming ""I'm God"", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.

If you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled ""My trial by fire at Backwoods"" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.

I will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.

Oh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called ""anti-psychotic"" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. 

I still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.

I don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. 

I vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life.

I was at a rodeo and the spectators had mostly left but all the cowboys and cowgirls were doing their last runs, it was much quicker than the show but I stayed because I was enjoying the whole thing so much. My son and dog had luckily just gone home. It was our first rodeo. The crowd left because it was hot and a storm was rolling in, lighting had start but it looked to be miles away and the thunder wasn't loud. It started to sprinkle but hey it's cooling us off so they keep going. Next thing I know the biggest thickest lightning bolt hits very close, I've never heard anything so loud. I paused and then we heard yelling and I just ran that direction faster than I've ever ran. A man was laying on his back, he was struck by lightning. It was so dark over there..he was near the horse trailers. An older man started CPR and he was yelling ""it's Tom it's Tom"" (not his real name) I said I can take over when you're tired just let me know as I knelt down to feel for a pulse, he didn't have one, I continued feeling for a pulse while holding his hand saying stay with us Tom we're here with you, help is right there. I saw his wedding band and I said what's his wife's name I'll find her and someone said she's not here his daughter Katie is here she's on a horse. Then the man asked me to take over, I did a few compressions and by that time the ambulance made its way there and the paramedics took over. The older gentleman left to gather his family and animals and I assume just get to safety. By this time it's pouring and the paramedics are doing CPR so I went back to holding his hand telling him he wasn't alone and Katie is alright. The paramedics had me grab a towel from the ambulance to keep the rain out of his mouth while they tried the defibrillators. I could smell and taste burnt even before they used them. My phone is ruined because it fell out of my pocket and it was raining, but I honestly think it's acting more like it's fried from the electricity. It keeps posting this before I'm finished typing. I have played Tetris multiple times. I didn't find out the outcome until this afternoon and he did pass. I still randomly smell and taste it in my sinuses. I just don't know what to think, I've only heard of this kind of thing. His daughter is only 18 and his son is only a couple years older than her. He was a veterinarian.

"My boyfriend purposefully triggers me to get his own way 
My boyfriend always brings up the time I was raped. He uses it as an insult almost trying to play it off like I cheated on him or something.

It‚Äôs getting me down so much. I don‚Äôt understand what he wants me to say. I dident ask for it.

He keeps trying to stop me from doing normal things. I want to go out with my friends still. I still want to wear dresses. I still want to drink. Every time I mention I‚Äôm going to go out with my friends he will try to scare me out of it telling me I‚Äôm going to be raped again and how he won‚Äôt care this time because of whatever dress im wearing etc

I don‚Äôt want to be raped again. I also don‚Äôt want to be miserable for the rest of my life. It just feels like I‚Äôm trying to move past my rape. But he keeps dragging me back to it, blaming me for it, purposefully triggering me and making me panic so he gets his own way.

When he dosent want me to go somewhere he‚Äôll put his hands on my neck in a choking type of way and say things like ‚Äúyou want this to happen again ? It will happen if you leave the house‚Äù

He dosent choke me but he puts his hands there cause he knows it triggering enough to make me panic so I‚Äôll stay at the house like he wants me too.

It feels disgusting to know I told my boyfriend details of my rape because I thought he‚Äôd be the one to help me overcome my fear. Instead he knows that hands on my neck will scare me so he does it on purpose to get what he wants.

I‚Äôm so done but I can‚Äôt leave I just can‚Äôt it‚Äôs too hard but sometimes I just wish he wouldn‚Äôt be such an asshole.",negative,ptsd,2021-02-01 20:03:50
"Who else here has problems with concentration and memory Where to start?

I want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.

I went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.

I wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.

I remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. 

I really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.

I don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.

I just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.

I feel stuck. I don't want to remember. I really, really don't want to remember more then I already do.

Is there really no other way, no other therapy to get better? To improve my concentration?",negative,ptsd,2020-12-10 15:10:10

"I'm a middle-aged dude and finally ghosted an abusive parent. Its both wonderful and terrible. TW: references to physical and sexual abuse

I thought I'd share this both because I could use the support and because I think people may find solace in knowing that others share their struggles even at an older age.

I'm in my early 40's, and a father. This past week I blocked my mother's phone and all of her social media contacts. She abused me physically and mentally over the course of my childhood. She even helped cover up the sexual abuse of one of her boyfriends. All so she could continue getting a child support check. Throughout adulthood I still kept in touch, even though almost every conversation revolved around either shaming me for my life's choices, or begging me to assure her that she was a good parent. 

After finally convincing myself (with the help of my therapist) that I needed to just cut all ties, it still took me several days to block her on different platforms. A part of me kept waiting for her to notice, but nothing ever happened. It's been a week, and I'm both glad I finally took steps to cut all ties and scared of her potential reaction.

"My therapist ended our services together today, even though we both acknowledged my high support needs My therapist, who I've been seeing for over a year now, dumped me as a client. I've had this happen before. Once it was because my provider stopped taking my insurance, once it was because my provider was moving- both times I had a heads up. 

Today, my former therapist told me that she's not suitable to treat me and that I should find someone new. This was after expressing my disturbing experience from a recent medication withdrawal to her just last week, as well as expressing my dismay in not being able to access residential care. These are both indicative of a person having high support needs. 

Instead of ending our services in a professional, reasonable manner, she was audibly frustrated enough to blurt out that she ""obviously isn't much help"" and won't be making any more appointments with me. I said something along the lines of ""so you're going to just remove the services I DO have? With no help to arrange anything else?  Do you know how long waiting lists in this area are?"" and she pretty much alluded to ""yeah, you can call the office of the practice and see if anyone else is available."" 

I called the front office and explained that I need a new trauma informed therapy provider and the receptionist told me they don't allow switching providers within the office. (Uh, okay.) I defeatedly said ""okay"" and ended the call shortly after. They, however, arranged further access to their office by talking to the president of the practice, who instructed them to find me someone else. I have an appointment next week with the new person.

Then calling a friend, getting her to stop by yours before she gets there to take your gift and lie for you by saying I had to work (night shift, I'm a nurse).

Then, spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event, ruminating on what they're doing, what they're talking about and the memories they're making without you. Knowing it's just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things.

"Every since my girlfriend died in front of me, I haven't been the same. I saw the love of my life fall head first, down a 300ft cliff... She got knocked out instantly and tumbled for 200ft and then fell off another cliff (50ft)and landed on sharp rocks...

I tried to rescue her and almost fell off the cliff as well, I knew I had to get down there as fast as possible because I was afraid she fell unconscious into the ocean, and I wanted to keep her head above water. Time was of the essence but it was impossible to get down there with out killing myself in the process. I knew that and I had to make the horrible decision to stay on top of the cliff, call 911 and let her drown.

There was nothing I could have done differently, the firefighters got there with in 10 minutes and they started searching for her body, meanwhile the police started interrogating me and I got the impression they thought I pushed her off the cliff. Everyone told me they were looking for her corpse, which reinforced the idea that she was dead.  I even thought I saw her body in the water at one point. I couldn't stop crying, I was hyperventilating, screaming, and I was pretty much hysterical... essentially, it was a pure nightmare.

I kept telling myself ""I need to wake up, I need to wake up, please just wake up, this can't be real!""

I didn't know why it was happening to me, all I wanted was to go 20 minutes back in time.
I couldn't understand why we were ok and laughing 20 minutes earlier, and then all the sudden, she was dead and I was never gonna see her again. It was an extremely difficult thing to process and I was completely in denial.
She was the most amazing woman I had ever met in my entire life, she was beautiful, smart, she was a critical thinker and she was even working on having her own ted talk about consciousness and quantum physics. She was smart but also fun to be around, we cracked jokes all day long and the 2 of us were just goofballs most of the time. I honestly couldn't believe how happy we were together all the time, it was almost like a dream, We even talked about getting married.

Three helicopters were there, the press was there, but ultimately a police drone found her. She was alive, and waving at the drone.
The firefighters were able to get her back up by using a crane and multiple ropes.
Her face was so bloody I could only see the white part of her eyes. 
I wanted to talk to her but the cops were blocking me because they still thought I tried to kill her.(I didn't)

They wouldn't even let me see her at the hospital for 2 days!
The cops asked her if I pushed her off the cliff, she said no and then I was able to see her... It was harsh, they shaved her head and there were so many sutures all over her scalp... She stayed in the hospital for almost 2 months. Fast forward 15 months and she's now able to walk again and has somewhat of a normal life, she still has brain damage from the fall, and we can't really do much anymore. We used to party every week end but we can't do that anymore, which breaks my heart, but at least she's still alive.

I want to get to the point, here is why I'm telling this story:

Ever since it happened, I keep thinking she's going to die at any moment. Every time she gets in a car or walks down the street, I think she's gonna get run over or stabbed by homeless people.
When she's eating I think she's gonna choke to death, also because she does choke a lot since her accident.( Personally I have almost choked to death 7 years ago and someone saved my life by doing the hemleich manoeuver on me.)
And every time she chokes I think she's going to die if she chokes alone someday and I'm not there to do the heimlich manoeuver on her and save her.

She took an uber to the doctor today and I'm terrified the uber is gonna crash the car and kill her. When I sleep with her I wake up in panic and check to see if she's still breathing...
I think about the accident all the time, and the way I felt when I realized she was dead.
It was the worst I had ever felt in my life, I felt so broken, and alone. I couldn't even tell her how broken and how sad I was.
It really left a mark, I haven't been the same since. And she hasn't been the same either, it's almost like the person I knew died, in some way.

I still feel like the girl I loved is still at the bottom of that cliff...

Anyway, thank you for reading, english isn't my first language.. thank you for bearing with me.

I would love to stop living in fear, I'm just not as innocent and naive as I used to be, I know the universe can take away everything that I love in an instant, and that terrifies me.
I don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life...

"Happy rant: I had sex without having a panic attack, crying, or dissociating! CW: Sexual assault/abuse, pedophilia, panic attacks

I am so happy and just proud of myself in general. I was molested and sexually abused as a kid, and it left me with a lot of emotional scars. I get flashbacks and panic attacks a lot, and even in a safe, consentual environment if someone touches my genitals I have always either started crying or dissociated. 

I've been on tinder lately and I met this really sweet woman (lets call her Stephanie) and we sent each other memes for a couple days. We decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music, spirituality, art, being gay (we're both women), and we really hit it off. We went to the book store and then played video games at target, and then we went to a park. We kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and I felt really comfortable with her. We decided to go to her house to watch a movie.

Long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex! It was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone. I didn't even have a glimpse of a flashback. This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date.

Edit: thank you everyone for your support on this post, I seriously posted this because I couldn't say it out loud but getting it off my chest made me feel so much better, and then seeing all the love I got on Reddit and the community here, I'm not as alone as I feel and I just really appreciate everyone here.

"DAE feel like they‚Äôre lying when sick? My mother used to scream and swear at me every time I was sick, she would call me a liar and other nice things. And now, every time i‚Äôm sick I feel like I‚Äôm just lying to myself and everyone else.
Example: I‚Äôve been unable to go to work for the past 3 days because I literally am nauseous and stuck in bed all day, can‚Äôt eat can‚Äôt drink and yet I get this feeling that I‚Äôm just pretending.

"Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?

I really liked this quote:
""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present."" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

I notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.

Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path? Also... Ugh doesn't it suck?? I feel like I am getting in my own way if healing even though I know it is deeper than that and I have to be patient.",negative,ptsd,2021-07-24 21:54:44

"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you? Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?

I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn‚Äôt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn‚Äôt sexualize me.

Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don‚Äôt want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don‚Äôt want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!

I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!

So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. 

However, I‚Äôm also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn‚Äôt able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.

 I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for.

"Everyone assumes military I told a coworker a few weeks ago that I had a doctor's appointment and he asked why. I couldn't think of a lie in time so I just told him ""Because I have PTSD"" (which was the truth). His response was, ""You were in the service?"" I said, ""No, my dad was a piece of shit"" to which he just said ""Oh, yeah, me too"" and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that. 

I'm not really angry about it or anything - just bored enough to complain about it - but I hate how everyone assumes that if you have PTSD you must have served in the military. Just weird to me that nobody thinks of all the other possibilities.",negative,ptsd,2019-12-31 01:47:31
"DAE HATE when people say ‚Äúit will get better‚Äù or ‚ÄúI went through x and got through it with praying, you should too‚Äù? Or am I just sensitive and caving to the aggression of my PTSD symptoms? It really plants a deep seed of anger and irritation in my heart when I hear those words. I also hate being told that I have to be strong, even though I know it‚Äôs relatively decent ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. No shit, I have to be strong. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt even be here right now. 

Someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident (breakup of a <2 year relationship), and got through it by praying to God, saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life. And while yes, he is valid to feel upset about it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it. They and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that I need to get off of and being the passive dipshit I am, I agreed with them and went along with all of it. 

Not to mention, when I told them I have PTSD, they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked ‚Äúoh, what are your visions?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat are your nightmares?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat do you see at night?‚Äù and a TON of follow-up questions that forced me to go into detail that I didn‚Äôt want to. Again, I‚Äôm passive as hell so it‚Äôs not easy to say no to anyone, but I just wish people were more considerate and understanding. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents, or to never make any quick movements, so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs?

"PTSD IS REAL. Most everyone here already knows this. This is to the people who dis-believe in it and I hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed.

The insomnia is real. No one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4AM, be tired as hell in the morning ,and feel like ran over garbage.

The triggers are real. Certain movies, noises and visuals can cause anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and sadness to the point of crying (even for non-cryers). This is due to the feeling of re-living the event(s).

The trust issues and suspicions about people are real and don't take it personally. Ever hear ""I like to keep most things to my self""? That's an auto-response, nothing personal.

The nightmares are real. Sometimes nightmares of re-living the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions; often ruining your entire day/days.

Anxiety is real and is often because of [insert event(s)]. Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.

Avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just ""faking it"". It's a logical, natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it.

An aversion to being physically touched is real. Ever hear ""don't touch me"", or the person is uncomfortable with being touched? Well the [insert event] is *likely* related to that. Again, don't take it personally.


Point being: no one fakes anything I listed above for the sake of feeling pity or ""just playing the victim"". It's a real problem just like anything else and it doesn't *only* apply to veterans and law enforcement.

Hope I could shed some insight.",negative,ptsd,2019-04-10 08:22:29

I use to be on point with my personal hygiene - haircuts every 2 weeks like clockwork, daily showers (sometimes more than one if I worked out), you know the basic self care things .....

Well I've spiraled into a really deep depression and have just given up on everything ..... the only thing I've made sure is that I wear deodorant and clean clothes (which is a miracle in itself ....) but then I got the flu .... and I've been sick for a few days without being able to do any laundry or even really get up and you know how you get that sweaty gross feeling?

"Envious of people without trauma Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years now and have discussed this in sessions, although I find it difficult to make friends who experience similar things so I guess I‚Äôm just wanting to vent and see if anyone can relate. Does anyone else get extremely envious of people with healthy, happy lives? I have CPTSD and like many of us, my childhood and early adult life up until the age of 20 was a complete shitshow. I get incredibly sad and oftentimes envious of my friends and relatives who had good childhoods and today lead great lives. They have successful jobs, plenty of financial and family support, go on vacations & trips regularly, have fun and spontaneity in their lives. My family is either dead, sources of trauma, or far away. Sometimes I feel like a bad person for being unable to be happy for them but I can‚Äôt shake it. So much was stolen from me and my life is still not great despite being diligent about attending therapy and implementing the tools and concepts into my life.

"Holy shit therapy works. Crying with happiness. It's only in the last few years I've had the diagnosis (29f). Previously I've had counselling after a bad patch in university, then went on some anxiety/depression courses after that but it never quite fit. It was only when the mental health service asked if I'd ever considered PTSD then asked me a bunch of screening questions and it fit to a tea. 

I've had some EMDR therapy which was hard and horrible but helped. I did a lot of self soothing for my inner child. Had a lot of dissociative episodes after heavy sessions. Had terrible nightmares for years. Felt rubbish and fatigued for years. My therapist left the service but I was feeling 80% better. 

I had stressful time at the start of the year (work stress causes more intrusive thoughts and anxiety) and contacted the service again about finishing up cos I felt I still had those symptoms and they would surface with a vengeance. 

Just had a few more intense weekly sessions and the last couple have been awful. But the flashbacks were less clear. Then since my last session I've not had any sleep troubles or nightmares or anything. We rescored my questions and I've gone from around 40 to 8.  I've been discharged from the service and I've just cried with happiness. I feel free and whole.

"I (17) once saw my childhood abuser (19) at a diner. We were both kids. I realized I didn‚Äôt have to be angry anymore. We‚Äôve both grown up. After years of being so angry and afraid of some threat bigger than me, I realized after seeing her that she didn‚Äôt scare me anymore.

I cried on the way home. Not from fear, but from relief. She apologized and told me that she didn‚Äôt expect forgiveness. That‚Äôs something no one who‚Äôs hurt me ever said. She‚Äôs gotten so much better. I realized that she was also just an abused kid.

"Does anyone else get pissed they say something was traumatic when it just straight up isn‚Äôt? I don‚Äôt mean this in a way to downplay other people‚Äôs traumas. But the amount of times I‚Äôve heard people say something was traumatic when it just straight up *wasn‚Äôt* bothers me. I‚Äôm thinking of two specific examples here.

The first happened a few days ago when one of my professors was talking about getting her infant child vaccinated. She said it was traumatic for *her* even though *her baby was chillin* throughout the appointment.

The second was way back in high school when I had a friend say they had trauma around cats because *one time* a cat‚Ä¶. scratched her. Like. Bruh.

I get that trauma can come in all shapes and sizes but tbh it just really bothers me when I hear people talk like this or make jokes about it. I feel it makes those of us who have actual trauma and PTSD minimized and makes it seem like PTSD is just a silly little thing that‚Äôs easy to get over.

"Psychiatrist said it's impossible for me to have PTSD I brought up that I think I have PTSD from my near death experience last year where I had multiple bowel obstructions and internal hernias causing excruciating pain that I endured for over four hours before the doctors could get me into surgery.  Seriously the worst pain I have ever felt and I've had it happen before that along with my gallbladder almost rupturing.  This was so much worse that I begged the doctors to kill me.  I still have nightmares about it and my anxiety shoots through the roof whenever I get stomach pains.  

Anyway, my psychiatrist said that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD.  That goes against everything that I have read on the subject.  I really liked him up until this point, as it has been really hard finding psychiatrists who take my insurance.  He gave me a prescription for Prazosin.

"I killed my grandmother, and then I did it thousands more times, and I don't know how to stop 50 years ago I went to the store with my grandmother, on the way there was a cemetery and I absolutely wanted us to stop by, so we walked up, my grandmother grabbed the handle and said that unfortunately the cemetery was closed. So we went on, did some shopping and were about to go home when I reminded my grandmother that we had forgotten something. We went back and as we passed the cemetery once again, a truck hit us on the curve. Grandma covered me with her body and took all the impact on herself. She died. I survived. I was taken from the scene of the accident to the hospital, where I lingered without visiting a family member. They came to pick me up after my grandmother's funeral, after a few days. When I realized that my grandmother was buried in that cemetery to which I wanted to see her off, I decided in the mind of the 3-year-old I was then, that I was the one who killed her.

For the past 50 years, I have been dressing up as a woman, strangling her and hanging her to re-enact the event. At the same time, I am afraid that someone will discover that I killed my grandmother. Any reenactment can end in death, because I am relieved only by the extreme state of experience on the borderline between life and death. 

It's difficult for me to talk about it with my family, who thinks there's nothing to talk about after 50 years. I can hear this for decades. They don't know what I'm going through when I fall into a complusive sequence of trauma-play that sometimes ends in psychotic states.

I feel like I've fucked up everything in my life, precisely because of this. Sometimes I can't believe I'm alive.

"Memory loss after arguments? One HUGELY annoying thing about my PTSD is that I seem to blank out during arguments so that afterwards I can't remember what the person said or did.

"People diagnosed with PTSD, are you ever inexplicably drawn to or aroused by the type of abuse you went through? Do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? What is your reaction to the triggering usually like when you do that? (TW) (Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don‚Äôt have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim‚Äôs body ‚Äúresponds.‚Äù 

In one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it‚Äôs of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù But isn‚Äôt that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?


Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I‚Äôm this way but it‚Äôs a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?

Are any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren‚Äôt triggered by it, then what triggers you? 

Second part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? 

I was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that‚Äôs what had got me thinking. If you search ‚Äútrigger on purpose‚Äù you‚Äôll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

And also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. 

A recap of the questions:

1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? 

2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? 

3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? 

4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?

I ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.

That sounded a little different from what I‚Äôve read from people‚Äôs experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?

"I HAD AN EXORCISM DONE TO ME WHEN I WAS 8 I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I have a lot of other stories (let me know if you‚Äôd like to hear more,) but here is one that really never left my head. When I was 8 (21 now,) I lived in an apartment with my mom, my brother, and me. My mom was addicted to amphetamines and was always living in this ghostly world. I remember her doing Oracle readings with me, I remember her having seances, and I remember me having strange things happen to me as a kid that I couldn‚Äôt make sense of. I kept coming to my mom with these problems and she believed I was possessed by a demon. I remember her taking me out to the the kitchen and there was a man with a cross on. He read the Bible over me and put holy water on my head and I just remember my mom screaming ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name, what‚Äôs your name!?‚Äù And as an 8 year old I was confused I was scared and I was in shock. I told her I was me and she proceeded to say it was demon speaking for me. I remember looking up at the ceiling fan And I started following one with my eyes and from there it felt like I left the whole room. That was the first time I ever dissociated and it hasn‚Äôt stopped since that day. My mom went to prison and has been clean for many years now. I just recently asked her about this and she still truly believes that there were demons in that house and that was the end of it. Not the closure I needed. I didn‚Äôt even realize this affected me for so long until a couple months ago when I brought it up to her.  I‚Äôve never really told anyone about this story..

I have a coworker who for the past few weeks has realized I‚Äôm very jumpy and easily startled, so he‚Äôs been scaring me multiple times a day. Jumping out from behind hiding spots and making a big noise, suddenly yelling or clapping behind me when I‚Äôm focusing on something.

I‚Äôve put a lot of work into recovery with therapy, a lot for me has improved, but my body still goes from 0-100 when someone scared me like that.

But I know I don‚Äôt *have* to do that anymore, I am safe now, it‚Äôs safe to stand up for myself. When I see my coworker today, I‚Äôm going to take him aside and tell him ‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt meant any harm by scaring me, I know it seems like a joke and I haven‚Äôt said anything, but I need you to stop doing it. I have PTSD, and being scared like that constantly is a lot more harmful and intense for me than the average person.‚Äù

EDIT- update

Hi guys, I did it and it thankfully went pretty smooth. I kept it simple and didn‚Äôt straight up say I have PTSD- basically just told him it is causing me stress and that I need him to stop. He was very apologetic (it felt genuine) and said he would stop, acted kind of awkward and avoidant for the rest of the shift but I expected that. I think he will definitely listen and stop, and if he doesn‚Äôt, I can take it to my boss and HR. But I have a good feeling from how things went and felt that it will be ok and won‚Äôt come to that.

I really appreciate all the support and advice today on this post, it helped give me the strength to stand up for myself and actually say something.

"Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse) TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again.

"I used my schizophrenia emergency card last night, and it got me out of a lot of trouble! So, I don't know why, but I know I was behaving very oddly walking around my apartment complex. I got lost in my own complex. A police officer showed up, I guess someone called him because of me, and started asking me a bunch of questions. I was in psychosis but he may have thought something else was wrong. So he wants me to take him to my apartment.

I go in, I'm soooo out of it, but this is where it really saves my ass. I didn't realize it, but I walked into the wrong fucking apartment. It took me and even the officer a few minutes to figure out what was wrong. I was 2 buildings down from my apartment. Nobody was there even though I heard people in their rooms. The police officer figures this out and immediate starts asking ""how much did you have to drink today?"" and I somehow remembered my schizophrenia medical alert card that I ordered when it got popular on this sub a few weeks ago. I handed it to him and he made a face like ""uhh what's this?"" but as soon as he saw it was a med ID his whole demeanor automatically changed. He became a lot more relaxed and understanding. He just said ""come on, lets get you home"" and walked with me and made sure I got home safely.

I'm so thankful for this card, this interaction could have been SO much worse.

I highly recommend getting one! I never thought it would actually help me so much!

"DON'T üëèSMOKE üëè WEED üëè I know I'm probably going to get some flak for this post, but I hope some of you can learn from my mistakes. 


I've smoked weed sometimes in the past. I would usually get some light paranoia and more hallucinations than usual, but I could deal with it. 


On Thursday last week, my friend came over. They brought some LEGAL weed (weed is illegal in my country), and said it had a very low amount of THC, which sounded possible. Products with a negligble amount of THC are legal. 


I've been feeling awful lately. Flashbacks and anxiety attacks. So I thought I could smoke some and feel a bit more relaxed, since my friend said it was basically just CBD in the joint. 


I smoked half of the joint, and felt fine. Until I didn't. 


An hour after smoking, I got very overstimulated by lights and sounds. 20 minutes later, and I was losing my grip on reality. Hallucinations overwhelmed me, and I felt myself slip into a state of not being able to tell what was real or not. 


I kept seeing visions of me hurting myself, hurting my partner, I was crying and shaking, my heart beating faster than I've ever tried before. I was living my worst nightmare. 


I asked my partner to take me to the psychiatric hospital. I was trying so hard to keep my grip on reality, but I kept getting confused and I was absolutely terrified of hurting my partner. 


We arrived at the hospital, and I felt more safe, and then I lost the last contact with reality. I wasn't frightened as much anymore, since I thought I was dreaming. I got some antipsychotics and got a bit better at the hospital. My partner was there, holding my hand. 


I went home, stayed at home for a few days and felt fine, and then the psychosis came back. I'm now back in the hospital. Not quite sure if I'm delusional or not. Maybe I am, or maybe I'm right. 


I see a lot of you asking in this forum, if it's alright to smoke weed or not. It can be. It was okay-ish for me for many, many years. And then suddenly it really, really wasn't. It was the worst nightmare of my life. Please. Think before you smoke.",negative,schizophrenia,2024-06-14 11:59:35

If you're not familiar, r/ShowerOrange is simple. Eat an orange in the shower... but you have to eat it like an apple, no wedges. (Yes, peel it first) I've been intrigued for a while but I tried it on a whim because it was time.

It helped me because I have problems getting in, the temperature chance, the liquid, it's a lot of stimulus.

"My Dog Died My baby shih-tzu Harry passed away from some sort of heart attack today. He was on the couch in our den. He was struggling to breathe this morning but acted as if everything were still okay. By the time I realized he should probably go to the vet, he was gone in the next 30 minutes. He died an arms length from me. I pet him, tried to get him to blink like the emergency vet said, but it was too late, he had passed on. I would by lying if I didn't say I am absolutely heartbroken and devastated. My other dog is having seizures too and we expect to lose her soon. Please, any thoughts or prayers would be welcomed.

"""You don't look like you have schizophrenia."" I don't look like I have schizophrenia, but I stay silent in fear that I will say something inappropriate, or have a word salad fall out of my mouth. You percieve this as shyness.

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder. 

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, because the whole world would fear me if I did. And when I DO act out of character, because my mask has become too heavy, you are shocked. You perceive this as selfishness, toxicity, or childlike.

This was for one round of the Invega injection at my pharmacy (I cant reliably take pills and have no one to enforce them.)  Mine is paid for by Medicaid. 
Non schizo folks seem to love to call us cRaZy bc we cant manage symptoms flawlessly to their specifications and will preach ""Get help :) go to the psych ward :) see a doctor :) Medications and therapy. You dont HAVE to be like this youre choosing to remain that way"" and treat mentally ill people like shit bc we dont seek healthcare (in the USA most people CANT. Not even for immediately life threatening things sometimes.) 
Slinging ""Get help"" as an insult bc were viewed as ""difficult and off putting"" comes from an insanely ignorant, privileged place, and it helps perpetuate the stigma and stereotypes about schizo people imo. Its frustrating and hurts my heart. We dont choose this and sure as shit dont choose to keep dealing with symptoms. I just want ppl to see this to raise awareness. Most of us legitimately cannot seek help. Its gatekept by capitalism/Big Pharma and if we were capable of being in a place to financially foot the bill we probably wouldnt need medical intervention to begin with.

"Spending Thanksgiving in the Psychiatric Ward  Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm spending this Thanksgiving in a psychiatric hospital, and while it‚Äôs not the holiday I imagined, I wanted to take a moment to send love and good vibes to everyone out there‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre celebrating with family, on your own, working, or navigating your own challenges.

Being here has reminded me how important it is to take care of our mental health, even when it means stepping away from the usual traditions. It‚Äôs hard, but I‚Äôm trying to focus on gratitude for the little things: the staff who are kind, the support from other patients, and the hope that things can get better.

If you‚Äôre struggling today, just know you‚Äôre not alone. Sometimes the holidays can feel heavy, and it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre just getting through it one moment at a time. Take care of yourself in whatever way you need, and don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out for support if you need it.

"Living Well With Schizophrenia claims to be ‚Äúcured‚Äù? Hi,

I‚Äôve been following a channel previously called ‚ÄúLiving Well With Schizophrenia‚Äù. It‚Äôs run by Lauren. Recently, she changed her channel‚Äôs handle to @LivingWell**After**Schizophrenia

She also changed her channel description to this:

> **I used to live with schizophrenia**. At the beginning of 2024 I began a strict program of metabolic therapies, specifically the medical ketogenic diet, to heal my brain. The result has been the elimination of all symptoms of schizophrenia, while also tapering off of all psychiatric medication. This is my journey of **living well after schizophrenia**.

(Emphasis added by me)

Afaik, Schizophrenia is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured yet and does not go into long term remission **without active medical management**. Such a person would still have schizophrenia, but would not experience symptoms, as long as they remain under treatment.

The way Lauren has worded this post, she makes it seem that her diet has ‚Äúcured‚Äù her schizophrenia and that she will make videos about living life after being cured of Schizophrenia

I have read medical literature about the medical ketosis diet. There are zero publications or case studies claiming that a schizophrenia patient can 

1) start medical ketosis diet

2) stop taking all schizophrenia meds

3) ‚Äúbe cured‚Äù

4) eat a less strict diet and never have schizophrenia symptoms ever again

If what Lauren had said 

>‚Äúmy doctors believe that, as long as I stick to my diet, my schizophrenia symptoms will never return,‚Äù then that would still be a remarkable claim! 

But by saying 

>‚ÄúI used to live with schizophrenia,‚Äù 

It makes me think that Lauren truly believes that she no longer has a mental illness at all. Does Lauren really believe that she is cured, or am I missing something?

Is Lauren being way too optimistic? Is Lauren spreading misinformation about schizophrenia? Or has Lauren and her doctors cracked the code and literally cured schizophrenia?",positive,schizophrenia,2024-09-22 07:11:18

"I cooked without feeling suicidal today Usually cooking is my coping mechanism whenever my delusions or suicidal thoughts become too much. But today was different, I did it for fun. Because I wanted to. I didn't think of anything bad when I chopped the vegetables or had any delusions because I was too busy listening to my playlist as I cooked. This is chicken curry by the way, it doesn't look the best but it was wonderful. I was worried that I chopped the potatoes and carrots in a way that was too big for it to be properly cooked. But it ended up being really tender when I poked it with my fork, same thing with the chicken! My family liked it too.

Most days I don't have the energy to do anything other then rotting away. So today was a good day. I wish it could stay this way but it never really does. I'll just hold on until I can feel this way again.",positive,schizophrenia,2025-05-12 10:44:55

Anagrams relating to this condition include:

The mental disorder, schizophrenia = oh, it's hoped the crazier mind learns! & A hidden peril, schizo's hear torment.

Art has been my main coping outlet since I was discharged from hospital in 2020, when I first started painting. Nearly 5 years later, painting has become one of my strongest tools for managing my schizophrenia and staying grounded.

Every flower I paint is my own vision ‚Äî they‚Äôre all inspired by the flowers I grow in my garden, which has also been an important part of my therapy. My process is simple but meaningful:
Grow the flower -> Photograph it -> Immortalise it on canvas or wood.

"My brother with schizophrenia jumped in front of a car going 60+ miles last Saturday. I watched him die in the ICU alone with me. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I knew he was schizophrenic and tried to tell my family long before he was diagnosed. They didn‚Äôt believe me. Even after he was diagnosed they didn‚Äôt buy it. Of course they tried to help, but they were treating it like someone going through a phase or like something that was temporary. 

I came here 6-ish months ago looking for help. You all gave me wonderful advice but it was me against my family and they wouldn‚Äôt listen. 

It just got too bad. He was too far gone. My family keeps telling me ‚Äúthere was nothing we could do‚Äù and that virtually all people with schizophrenia live terrible lives until they die alone (of course they finally admitted it was schizophrenia after he died).

"Im barely 21 and Im going to die of heart failure soon. Ive only really had disordered eating on and off for less than two years and have a normal BMI, and yet I'll be extremely lucky to live for even five more years. I felt 100% fine until well after Id irreparably damaged my heart. Get. Help. Now. #To anyone who's thinking of recovering and is looking for a sign...  
‚†Ä

‚†Ä

#this is your sign.

‚†Ä

My recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction, but my doc said he's ""75% confident"" that the fancier more complicated echo I'm getting sometime in the next couple days is probably going to show that I do, in fact, have Left Ventricular Heart Failure.

There's a *super* small chance it might have been caused by a chronic malformation of some kind that they missed the first time, but that's extraordinarily unlikely due to the fact that a left ventricular malformation bad enough to cause these issues now would've probably killed me as an infant.

**There is functionally zero doubt that disordered eating fucked up my body so badly in only 22 months that it'll take a** ***miracle*** **for me to make it through** ***five years*** **without dying of heart failure.**  
‚†Ä

I know that disordered eating helps you cope with things.

I know that it helps you feel in control of things.

I know that it's likely become so intertwined with your sense of self that you don't know where you end and it begins.

I know that the idea of talking to your parents or whoever else about it seems impossible.  
‚†Ä

**I know that recovery is scary.**  
‚†Ä

But trust me when I say that, if I could go through every last one of those struggles trillions of times over right now in order to not die in my early twenties, I would make that choice fucking instantly.  
‚†Ä

If you're like I was two years ago and your mental health is in a bad enough state that dying early seems preferable to you, *trust* me when I say that you absolutely do not want to let your ED damage your health like this.

**I am fucking miserable.**

I'm weaker and more exhausted by everything than my 80 year old grandmother.

My chest has hurt 100% of the time for the past 6 months straight.

Everything takes for*ever* to understand. It's like brain fog except that, instead of my mental capabilities being dulled by malnutrition, dissociation from body dysmorphia, and/or other mental health issues, my brain has gotten so badly fucked by my cardiac issues that it's *ridiculously* worse at literally fucking everything. Everything is 10x harder to understand, and it's *never* going to get better, not even if I get a heart transplant or they somehow figure out how to cure LVHF or som shit like that. This is from *physical* damage to my brain. That shit doesn't go away. 

You know how restriction can make you really dizzy? Take that and multiply it by a thousand. I am *a l w a y s* dizzy. Any movement more than like, slightly adjusting my sitting position can make it so bad I feel like I'll pass out. All the time.

Every single thing that I do feels like running a marathon. If I'm eating anything that's substantial enough to take even *five seconds* to take, chew, and swallow a small bite*, I have to catch my breath and take a two- or three-minute break afterwards in order to build back up enough energy to take another one.

This shit sucks. You don't want it. 
‚†Ä

**Recovery isn't something you can put off.** Take it from me, you don't have to delay it for very long at all before it's too late.

**Treat disordered eating like you would cancer. Both of them can become terminal** ***terrifyingly*** **quickly if you decide to wait for it to get ""bad enough."" Disordered eating of** ***any kind*** **is bad enough.**

‚†Ä

#TL;DR: Eating Disorders can and will kill you *ridiculously* fast. They are *urgent medical problems* and you need to try as hard as you can to get into recovery as soon as you can possibly manage.

#I didn't, and because of that I'm going to die in the *short* future. Please don't make the same mistakes I did.

"My GF just died from an eating disorder. I'm devistated. My GF was diagnosed with anorexia, binge-purging subtype.  We met after her last time in treatment.  She seemed to do okay for a while.  I didn't notice any issues, but I wasn't too familiar with the signs and symptoms of her disease.  Now that I have read up more thoroughly, all of the signs were there.

She wasn't losing that much weight.  She had always been thin, and was recently looking much thinner, but not scarily so.  A lot of weird things were happening though.  She would have nights where she would send me these illegible, very off texts.  I figured it was because she was drinking, but now I know it has to do with periods of confusion brought on by malnutrition and heart issues.  I think now I can remember her cheeks being swollen.  She had dry skin and was always cold.  She would just not remember things that we talked about recently.

Anyway, I had gone over to her house randomly last Wednesday and her roommate let me in.  I walked into her room like covered in food and trash.  Literally shit everywhere.  I knew immediately something wasn't right.  I comforted her, threw out all the trash, and talked to her about treatment.  She agreed and I called her mom who got the process started.  They said it would be like 4 weeks till their was room, but she was going to call on Monday to see if she could get in sooner.

I didn't hear from her all day Saturday.  She was going through a lot, and thought she needed space.  She also had a habit of sleeping during the day for like 10 hours at a time when she wasn't working. Her mom hadn't called me or her roommates so I didn't really worry.  I had told her everything was going to be fine I was just proud of her for agreeing to go to treatment.  

I didn't hear from her on Sunday either.  I texted her a bunch and also called her parents.  I gave them her roommates number to check in on her.  Even at that point, I was just worrying about her mental health.  I didn't think she was at risk for dying or anything.

On Monday her roommate called me and told me the news.  They found her dead.  I'm guessing it was due to heart issues from all the purging and restricting.  I don't know.  I'm just devastated and don't know who to talk to about it.  Despite this disease, she was a truly amazing person.  She was honest and kind and genuine and all we ever did together was laugh.  She was only 24.  I didn't know this disease could strike so suddenly. 

I feel so guilty.  I wish I would have read up more about her disease and acted sooner.  I just want to crawl into bed and die.",positive,eating_disorder,2021-03-30 16:31:29

"As someone who has been underweight, normal weight, and overweight, skinny shaming is NOT the same as fat shaming and I'm tired of naturally skinny people acting like it is. Before you come at me with the ""curvy is the new beauty standard"", I can assure you that it's not. Social media is not real life. Skinny is the beauty standard and always will be. If you ask literally anyone whether they would rather be skinny or fat, they will say that they'd rather be skinny 100% of the time. ""Fat"" will always be used as an insult. No one will ever say ""you look fat"" as a compliment. Nobody ever develops BED as a result of being skinny shamed, but thousands of people have developed anorexia and/or bulimia (at least partially) as a result of being fat shamed.

But he has witnessed years of my eating disorder and he knows I have talked extensively with my mom about it. He has seen my extreme weight loss, me crying when getting out of the shower with clumps of hair in my hands, me getting steamed veggies at a Napolean pizzeria in Italy.

So fast forward to today, my laptop is in service and I used his computer. Not gonna lie, I decided to lurk a little to see if there's anything remotely interesting. My boomer dad had an entire folder named after me that had dozens of articles downloaded or hyperlinks about anorexia, the root causes of it, how to tackle anorexia, how to behave to anorexic sufferers, what drives me to it. A whole ass folder of research on anorexia.

He also got a pop-up email notification for an order of NINE products that are for hair loss since he knows I complained and cried about it months ago, even though it has lessened significantly since then.

"i just found out my friend uses me as reverse thinspo. my life is falling apart right now, a lot of bad things just happened to me recently (on top of catching COVID, lmao), and then i stumbled onto a friends‚Äô anonymous pro-ana twitter, where there are pics of ME, (me on my birthday, at anime cons, at the pool and the beach), being lauded by her followers as reverse thinspo. i know it‚Äôs her because she has faceless ‚Äúbodycheck‚Äù pics on there and i would recogn ize her tattoos/room setup ANYWHERE.

i know this disorder affects us deeply and i KNOW we get intrusive thoughts that we cant help but this is just so insidious and awful. i just... ican‚Äôt imagine or fathom why she would do this. why ANYONE would do that to someone else. i‚Äôm so brokenhearted that i‚Äôm just another part of the competition to be seen as the skinniest and i‚Äôve been thrown under the bus for not being small enough. all by someone who i expected to understand what that feels like.

i don‚Äôt know what to do and i feel like this destroyed any appetite i had built trying to recover and eat normally. i dont even know how to address this with her, it‚Äôs giving me palpitations just thinking about how to bring this up.

UPDATE:

so, i confronted her with a ‚Äúhey, I need to talk to you about something serious‚Äù, and after she responded ‚Äúof course‚Äù, i sent her the screenshots and told her that i knew it was her (pointed out her room, furniture, clothes, her tats, how her mirror was even the same mirror she uses in her insta photos, etc.) i told her how deeply this hurt me and how, despite all we‚Äôve gone through together, she decided to use me as a prop.

BUT‚Äî after leaving me on read for an hour, she started claiming that the account wasnt her and that SHE‚ÄôS hurt i would ever accuse her of such a thing. and then suddenly, the account went private (this might have happened after i sent the messages, but it was public right before i texted her because i went to check if twitter had done anything to the posts). the profile picture was also suddenly changed too.

she is claiming that i‚Äôm gaslighting her to make her feel guilty, because ‚Äúim upset over my recent weight gain‚Äù‚Äî (i havent gained any weight at all recently, i‚Äôve only lost). basically, she‚Äôs managed to turn this around on me and said she was ‚Äúafraid this would happen‚Äù because ‚Äúeveryone leaves her eventually‚Äù.

i can‚Äôt believe the level of gaslighting right now. she hasnt responded to my response yet, and now im just... empty. i prepared for a hundred responses but not denial and accusations like THAT.

"the ‚Äúevery body is beautiful‚Äù movement is basically saying that no matter your size, you as a woman can be a desirable sex object I grew up with those Dove ads, with the growing discourse of  ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to be thin to be beautiful.‚Äù While I agree with that, I think focusing on beauty still sends the wrong message. Seeing those ads as a kid didn‚Äôt make me feel good about myself; they made me feel pressured to be beautiful, in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an object‚Äù way. 

The fact that ‚Äúevery woman is beautiful‚Äù is a more popular discourse than ‚Äúever woman is capable‚Äù (eg. smart, powerful, not limited due to being female) is legit troubling to me. It‚Äôs basically just western capitalism saying that all women are worthy of being objectified.

"PSA: Don‚Äôt take your clothes off for your guidance counselor TW: predatory (?) behavior 

When I was in high school, I was suffering with anorexia. I was reported to my school from a few teachers and students. I was sent down to the guidance office to have a talk. 

Well, the guidance counselor was a male. He didn‚Äôt believe that I had a disorder unless I took my clothes off. My advisor was also in the room, and she thought I should remove my clothes as well. I always wore baggy clothes so no one could see my body. He asked, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what anorexics do, isn‚Äôt it? We have to make sure you aren‚Äôt too underweight so take off your clothes‚Äù. 

The awful thing was, I was going to. I was ready to take off my clothes because I was so scared. My parents were out of town, and they threatened to send me in a mental hospital. The guidance counselor and advisor said they had a police officer ready to take me the mental hospital. I was terrified. 

I was about to take my clothes off, and they were so excited for me to do so. But my saving grace walked through the door. My school nurse was called in for my little meeting, but they forgot about that. She screamed at them for telling me to take my clothes off. She stopped me from doing it.

I felt so disgusted with myself that I was about to do that. I feel disgusted now that they are still working at my high school after I graduated. I wish I said something. I wish I wasn‚Äôt such a coward.

Before pro ana was more or less banned from the internet, people like this knew they were disordered and healthy outsiders knew not to take their advice because they knew they were disordered as well. Nobody went around praising anorexia as a healthy lifestyle; it was widely recognized as a choice to live to an unhealthy one. Now, these behaviors are socially acceptable and considered normal and healthy by your average person. While obviously not everyone who partakes in these behaviors is disordered, these ~tips n tricks~ are definitely less than healthy and were not mainstream before this shift. When these unhealthy behaviors had the bite of being labeled ‚Äúpro ana‚Äù attached to them, they were much, much less dangerous to your average viewer. 

When we said that it would be incredibly damaging to force pro ana folks to go incognito, they said it was just our ~disordered delusions~ and we were ~trying to manipulate people.~ They said they knew best about the kind of life that some of us have been living for longer than these websites have been around, and now society is paying the price.",positive,eating_disorder,2020-07-27 02:48:42

"This is not a recovery based, trigger free, safe space of a sub. I'm going to ruffle some feathers with this, but I've seen a lot of posts lately where people are upset with certain dialogue on this sub. 

People saying ""Please don't talk about or describe food because it triggers me...Im not comfortable eating like some of the people trying to recover or who have safe foods""

""Please stop talking about how little you eat. It's elitist and makes other people with binge related eating disorders feel invalid.""

""Please don't talk about how your so cold or dizzy or how all your clothes hang off you and how people are voicing concerns that you're underweight. It comea off as bragging about how 'bad' your ED is.""

""Please don't talk about x symptom because it makes people who don't have it feel like failures/inadequate.""

""Please don't talk about x negative thoughts because it is triggering and hurts my recovery efforts.""

""Please don't talk about how you don't like your body. It makes people feel bad about theirs too.""

This sub is not a recovery based sub. Its a place for people to vent about issues their ED causes in their life. Its a place to let out the thoughts their ED drills into them day in day out. It's a place to say ""I am so obsessed with food/weight/fear and it fucking sucks. It's a place for people to voice their problems without judgement, to people who understand how fucked up this disorder is.

Its not pro-ed. But it's also not a safe space.

I see a lot of people complaining about other peoples disorder triggering theirs because its different. That's not helpful and actually tells people ""you're not allowed to speak here."" ""Suffer in silence."" That goes against everything I understand this space to be...a place for us all to get the ED thoughts out of our head and maybe get some solidarity.

If you are trying to recover, remove this sub from your feed. You don't have a right to tell others to stop triggering you on a sub that never promised to have no triggers. You don't have the right to tell people to censor their disorder because it makes you uncomfortable. You are responsible for your well being and your recovery. Not other eating disordered people.

If you see something truelly harmful, alert the mods. Otherwise, scroll by or block users who bother you. Or better yet, unsub and focus your attention on the pro-recovery subs out there.

"My mom died from Anorexia Nervosa 3 weeks ago. Title says almost everything I need to say.  

She started about three years ago and eventually used it as a vehicle to commit suicide. In the last three months of her life she had so little muscle left that she could not walk or even get out of bed. During the last month she could not lift her head or move her arms.  During the last few days she could no longer even drink water through a straw.  A nurse came every week to exchange her catheter and my dad changed her diaper as needed. 

I am completely crushed and I just can't make sense out of any of it.  I'm pretty fucked up as a result of watching it happen and being powerless to stop it.

In anticipation of some questions I may be asked: 

* Yes, we did try to help her. She had been through longer-term hospitalizations twice and many shorter ones.  Recovery never took.  The doctors said she did not meet the guidelines to be forcibly fed and/or forcibly committed to a mental health facility.  We were only able to get her the treatment she consented to.

* She became orthorexic three years ago.  This devolved into ""I hate eating. I want to kill myself.  I wonder how long I can live if I just stop eating.""     

* The cause of death on her Death Certificate is Anorexia Nervosa. 

* She was an older person (late 60s) and I am an adult in my 30s.  I never knew her to be anorexic or display any anorexic tendencies during my entire life except during the last few years.",negative,eating_disorder,2020-08-03 17:17:00

"Death and recovery aren't the only two possible outcomes to your eating disorder. There. I said it. We have been told all our lives that the choices are either to recover, or eventually die. But for some of us, there's this grey area that we are stuck in, that doesn't end like that. We are underweight yeah, but barely, and our bodies don't show dramatic signs of anything wrong happening. We are never going to be sent to IP. We don't pass out in the street or anywhere. We eat, just less than we should. Our lives aren't hell on hearth, and we manage to have a job and sometimes even serious relationships. Our ED is constantly in our minds, but we manage to have hobbies and activities we enjoy. 

And we will probably be like this forever. 

This is reality for many MANY people who suffer from eating disorders, and we are continuously ignored by media, our family and even our therapist, because we do not fit the pre conception they have, and our bodies are not at an inmediate risk.  More should be done to get people like us to recover, because it's still fucking annoying to live with this bullshit.

"body positive models make me feel 500% worse I hate the body positive movement. It‚Äôs made me feel even worse about my body and my existence.

these ‚Äúbody positive‚Äù models usually are about 5-15 lbs overweight at most and still have a perfect waist to hip ratio, and not to mention a beautiful face. Although they may face oppression and discrimination in the modeling industry they would be worshipped in normal society.

It‚Äôs like these models are only allowed ONE flaw. If she has vitiligo, she has to be beautiful and thin. If she‚Äôs fat, she has to be beautiful and an hourglass. If she has a large nose, she has to have every other facial feature and her body make up for it. 

It‚Äôs even with actresses and other celebrities. When people say Jennifer Lawrence and Marylin Monroe are ‚Äúbody positive role models‚Äù I get dysphoric as fuck because they‚Äôre both way smaller and way more shapely than I could ever hope to be. I heard someone on the view say Kim Kardashian was a hero for women with big butts and thighs. I‚Äôm sorry, WHAT? I have a large ass and huge thighs and I‚Äôve never felt empowered by a woman with a waist half the size of mine.

Lastly, it seems like the body positive movement is first and foremost becoming mainstream because they want to sell you something. Plus size clothes, makeup to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù rather than conceal your beauty, the industry still preys on insecurities as much as it always have but is now peddling them as acceptance. 

I think we should stop trying to expand the definition of beauty. Not everyone is beautiful and that‚Äôs okay. Your worth is not determined by how physically attractive you are.",positive,eating_disorder,2020-11-22 16:11:28

"Shoutout to anorexics who began to lose weight when they were overweight/obese and everybody praises their weight loss despite their mental illness. Everyone who suffers with disordered eating is valid, and does not need to 'prove' that their disorder is 'bad' enough to be considered valid. 

But shoutout to those people whose weight loss was praised and they were encouraged to keep losing, which only lead to them becoming more and more disordered. Eating disorders are a mental problem.

"When I was fat... When I was fat a boy called me a beached whale in front of our sports class. The teacher told him to settle down as I felt my cheeks burn. 

When I was fat a  ‚Äúfriend‚Äù jiggled my double chin and said if I just lost weight I could be pretty. She told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when I smiled. It took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that. 

When I was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent. How could my brother be so athletic while I ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself? When he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me I was disgusting. He said he was embarrassed to tell people I was his daughter. 

When I was fat I bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party. I spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup, I squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long. When I got there the boy I liked looked me up and down, turned to his friend and  loudly whispered ‚Äúfat b****‚Äù. They laughed and left and I wished I could fall through the floor. When I got home that night I cried because I was a shy nerdy girl and I couldn‚Äôt imagine what I had done to make him say that. 

I thought I used food to control my emotions but really I was controlled by food. 

Every night when my family had gone to sleep I‚Äôd pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed. I‚Äôd buy it after school from the grocery store, a different one each time because I feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went - my cheeks, my waist, my thighs. 

I‚Äôd stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and I was sure I had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me I was. 

Over the past year I‚Äôve lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy BMI. I‚Äôve basically switched to a restriction ED, largely driven by the comments of people around me. 

And today the boy who called me a ‚Äùfat b****‚Äù asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other. He said I looked great and he wondered why we didn‚Äôt talk more in high school. I wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem. I wanted him to know how many nights I had spent crying over his careless words. But instead smiled and said I was happier leaving the past in the past.

I don‚Äôt know why I wrote this, I guess I‚Äôm just frustrated with how the world works. I wish I could have enjoyed high school, I wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight, I wish I didn‚Äôt think about food constantly. Oh well",positive,eating_disorder,2019-11-10 11:30:06

I guarantee you she'll be furious, and the first thing she'll bring up is money-how much money she spent on the tenderloin for Christmas. If I died from ths eating disorder, I swear, she'd complain about how expensive my casket was. I don‚Äôt care. I'm feeling better already.",negative,eating_disorder,2024-12-24 14:56:49
"""Men don't like skinny women"" is such a lie I'm so sick of Reddit threads being like, oh men prefer curvy women, men don't like stick figures, real women have curves, runway models are for women not for men...

Do they realize that 1- rich handsome men always date models, and 2- you can be both curvy and skinny? The most popular women on p-rn subreddits are all almost underweight with big hips and fake boobs. Being skinny doesn't mean you lose your curves, especially if you're tall (=need bigger hips) or naturally busty.

So yeah I'm really tired of all these men trying to reassure women or shame them into not restricting, because in the end they still put skinny-curvy women on a pedestal. And then say ""but these women have boobs, so they aren't skinny!"", bitch yes they are and I'm tryna look like them... Now can you let me become Emily Ratajkowski in peace please??? At this point when a man tells me not to lose weight it just feels like he knows he doesn't stand a chance with a skinnier woman.",positive,eating_disorder,2022-01-16 12:26:51
"I did some research on the BMIs people with EDs usually die at. It made me really sad, but I figured I‚Äôd share that info here due to how hard it is to come by accurate numbers on I‚Äôm hoping that by sharing it here I can minimize harm in some way. I looked at any study I could find with numbers. These are the BMIs of people who died despite hospital treatment and everyone doing their best to save them, so keep that in mind. I'm looking at the extreme limits of the human body here.

The BMIs that were lowest at death on average were the restrictive-subtype anorexics without any (listed) comorbid conditions (also not including suicides). Most died somewhere in the 10s to 12s. Maintaining a BMI under ~15 for an extended period of time seemed to increase risk of death a lot. Out of a study of 23, one anorexic made it to 9.1, this is the lowest BMI I‚Äôve found in any study. They died of cardiac arrest. One died of broncho-pneumonia at 16.8. In another study, others who died at ‚Äúhigher‚Äù BMIs died from gastrointestinal hemorrhage or septic shock (assuming from laxative abuse?), seizures, diabetes, or pneumonia/infections. Occasionally restrictive anorexics died from electrolyte imbalances at higher BMIs as well. The most common cause of death for this group  was cardiovascular/cardiac arrest or organ failure.

Next lowest on average were the binge-purge subtypes, and alcoholic anorexics of any subtype. Apparently alcoholism is very common along with EDs and deaths from a combo of the two seem to happen often. Benzodiazepines were another commonly abused drug leading to a higher likelihood of death. Another study mentioned alcohol abuse as the biggest predictor of death, especially when combined with an underweight BMI. Purging is also, obviously, terrible for you and causes heart issues and electrolyte imbalances that often lead to death. There was a greater range here, and those who died from something other than suicide died anywhere between a BMI of ~10 to 19.7. A few were listed as having a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù appearance at death after previously having gotten down to a very low BMI, though the specific BMIs of these was not recorded.

The last part makes me possibly the saddest. About half the deaths were from suicide, and it was the largest single cause of death. This included Bulimics, anorexics of any subtype, and EDNOS/OSFED. Suicides were relatively common among every group, but it looked like those who binge and purge were at the greatest risk of suicide overall. They died anywhere from the 12s to overweight.

So those are the statistics I‚Äôve found. Obviously this is only including deaths and not even mentioning the painful side-effects and health conditions resulting from EDs that usually start at much higher BMIs. Do **not** think your ED is any less serious just because of any of these numbers, these are literally the ultimate extremes and I was intentionally filtering things to look for people who died at lower BMIs. The majority of ED deaths from all causes happened at higher BMIs than the extremes I‚Äôve listed.

This is easier said than done I know, but if you don‚Äôt want to die a painful death then don‚Äôt drink or abuse drugs, don‚Äôt purge, and don‚Äôt get to an extremely low BMI. Keep your electrolytes in check. Most importantly, get your mental health taken care of. EDs are extremely deadly, devastating, and horrible for both your mental and physical health. Deaths from them and the unhealthy behavior surrounding it can pretty much happen at any weight.

"Anorexia Mirabilis Today I learnt about some of the history of eating disorders and ngl it's really interesting, especially seeing as anorexia nervosa is mostly documented from the 20th century onwards. 

Anorexia Mirabilis is from the middle ages and was basically where women and girls would starve themselves for God, as a sign of divinity. It was mostly Catholics that did it, but reading into some of the cases their behaviour mirrors the behaviour of many of us. 

Catherine of Siena had it, and she apparently learnt it from her sister (so clearly it ran in families) who used it to control her husband (control seems to be a theme). Catherine herself died from it, and it was recorded that if forced to eat, she would purge. 

Columba of Rieti is another example, and she also died from it, and she also engaged in self harm behaviours under the guise of religion. 

During the Victorian era there were 'fasting girls' who were often teenagers who claimed they were miracles who didnf require nutrition, one case was a twelve year old girl who stopped eating when she was ten. She was taken under medical supervision to see if she was genuine, where her parents then wouldn't allow her to eat even though doctors said she was dying, as they believed she was holy. She did die, and they were charged with manslaughter. 

It seems many fasting girls would secretly eat, whilst claiming they did not. Which mirrors the secret eating of many sufferers of eating disorders today, with the shame so many of us feel around eating and the irrational need to hide it when we do eat. 

Some of the fasting girls would also have stigmata, which is the Christian word for wounds or scars in the same place Jesus had crucifixion wounds, which sounds to me like self harm, a behaviour many people today with eating disorders have.

I just find it fascinating that for centuries it wasn't seen as a mental illness, but as a sign of religious devotion and that by using religion, sufferers had an excuse. It shows that while people claim it's all about the media and it's a 21st century and a first world problems- it clearly isn't as there have been clear cases of eating disorders dating back centuries, with self harm often being present at the same time. While the reasons for the disorders and the way they present themselves may have changed, eating disorders have clearly been a phenomenon for centuries and I find that fascinating ngl.",negative,eating_disorder,2020-06-14 12:41:55

Bullshit. I've been up and down in weight many many times in my life with the same low bar of confidence every time. People treated me better when I was thin because they liked the way I look. 

I wish people would be more honest about this stuff. I feel like it would in some ways be easier if everyone was just honest. All the instagrammers posting about ""being healthy"" and doing it for their bodies and feeling good, people talking about being concerned with other people's ""health"" and not the way they look, etc. I feel like there's a giant pink elephant in the room and everyone just pretends it doesn't exist. And I feel crazy because it seems like I'm the only one who can see the elephant. Let's be real, people care about how you look. They treat you better when you look better. 

Anyway that's my rant for today, thanks.",positive,eating_disorder,2020-11-15 02:57:45
"To the bone casting Lily Collins I‚Äôm sorry but if they‚Äôre goal was to show a realistic portrayal of anorexia without glamorizing it, why would they cast a universally beautiful actress, why would they dress her in the chic oversized dark clothes like it‚Äôs ‚Äútumblr aesthetic.‚Äù 
IMO they should have chosen a less conventionally attractive actress, and styled her to be ‚Äúoff‚Äù, closer to the weird unicorn girl at the residential place. 
Also at the beginning when she says ‚Äúsuck my skinny balls‚Äù you start off showing that she‚Äôs cool, chic, gorgeous, thin, and then through the movie you see her struggles with anorexia. I get there there were relatable non glamorized moments, and maybe it‚Äôs my own eating disorder talking, but using Lily collins to play a ‚Äúcool anorexic‚Äù character just glamorized the disorder more for me.",positive,eating_disorder,2023-01-17 13:22:28

"My dad always gets me a very specific order from Starbucks, and today they sent him home with a sweet message. [https://i.imgur.com/iTjoUVyh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iTjoUVyh.jpg)

For context, my dad gets me a 'Grande Cafe Misto with Almond Milk and SF Caramel' (48 kcal and lovely) pretty much every single day, since it's like.. My one source of comfort during the day. The local drive through SBs has gotten it wrong on occasion, leading to a lot of tears etc.

A few months ago, he explained to the woman whilst waiting that I had pretty severe AN, hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect, otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me. She sympathised and said she'd watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder, but thankfully she hasn't spiraled too far.

Anyway, now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart, and why it has to be so specific. He was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink, who know how & why, because they don't want to upset me and want to make sure it's always correct. He came home and had the above message written on my cup, and it just really made my day. It was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are, and understanding.

Sorry for the ramble, I just have nobody to share this with and I found it really sweet üòû

**Edit:** Thank you everyone, I forwarded on the comments to my dad & will also write to SB to name the branch & hopefully they'll get some worthy praise <3

Also, my dad has been incredible. He has Asperger's, but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something I'll always be thankful for - sadly we've both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so, but he's very supportive.

"Anybody else feel like the only choices they have in life is to starve or be fat? I don't feel like I've ever been able to have a healthy relationship with food. As a kid I'd say I ate normally, always had a sweet tooth though, which is something I've come to hate now. Then it feels like out of nowhere, like literally overnight, I lost all ability to eat normally. No joke, ever since around my 13th birthday were I suddenly developed a huge ass appetite it feels like I've completely lost the ability to eat normally. In my teen years I would be insanely hungry all the time and eating entire bags of chips on the regular and taking large portion sizes at dinner because my stomach felt like this huge black hole. I wouldn't call them binges by any means because I could always stop when I was full and never felt out of control but for whatever reason my body kept demanding food. Eating a ""normal"" serving size of anything and feeling satisfied, that ability stopped coming naturally to me at all. 

At the time I didn't think much of it and assumed it was because I was growing or whatever but looking back on it has made me flabbergasted. It's a miracle I only became overweight at 17 and not any earlier, and to be honest the reason why I was probably staying at a decent weight in my early teens while eating so much processed junk food is because I didn't eat breakfast or even lunch very regularly (not because of any disordered stuff, back then I mainly skipped breakfast because I wanted to sleep in a little extra before school). 

And now that the pendulum has swung in the other direction and I'm in my early twenties and I've developed an ED, lost all that extra weight and feel afraid of even perfectly reasonable healthy food it's made things more confusing. It really feels like I have to live with this disorder that makes me miserable and cold and makes me miss out on seeing family and friends as a price to pay to stay skinny, because if I didn't and went back to eating more I'd slide back into being overweight way too easily.

Sorry that I over-corrected a little too far for your taste, I guess? You really harped on how fat and disgusting I was during a super important time in my psychological development, so I guess I just figured better safe than sorry.

Really though, do they realize that they had a substantial fault in my developing an ed? Are they crying out of guilt? Do they ever wonder if they‚Äôd just minded their own business and not bullied an elementary school child about her baby fat, if I‚Äôd have a healthy relationship with weight and food? Are they crying for the reasons they *should* be crying? Because they feel terrible for the part they played in this?

On occasion he has also bought the Magnum tubs which I especially fear, eating the entire tub so I can have small spoonfuls. He has eaten large amounts of pasta and bought double portions of takeout. 

He just really wants to show me that these foods are not scary and that nothing happens when he eats them, kinda getting me used to having those foods around me again.

"My dad's cancer has 'cured' me of liking thinspo (I'm 25 F and have struggled with binging/restricting for about 4 years, although this past year I've been semi recovered) 

My dad got pancreatic cancer* this year and lost a ton of weight. He was so healthy and young, he was a healthy weight and was working out every week/going on walks all the time. He was an athlete when he was in college and was always a big strong lumberjack man. 

3 months later and he looks like a shiveled old man. All his muscles are gone. His spine/ribs are showing. He's skin and bones. He has a thigh gap, super visible collarbones, hip bones, etc. 


Its weird because it reminds me of bonespo/thinspo stuff, and now I can't look at a picture of an underweight person anymore without be so, so sad, and wishing they were healthy.

  I keep thinking of how I can't cuddle my papa anymore because he's in pain.

 How he sleeps 24/7 because he's exhausted. 

How he can't enjoy his favorite meals, because he's always trying to find something that doesn't make him throw up. 

Its just a weird time for me and it absolutely breaks my heart now when I see thinspo with tons of reblogs and likes, and all I can see is a human who is slowly dying. 

I just wanted to share, in case it helped anyone, or made someone feel less alone somehow.

"‚Ä¢ ""You look like you've lost weight"" nah I'm just fluctuating between the same 15lbs I always am, you just refuse to comment when I gain weight For the majority of my eating disorder my dad has commented that I look like I've lost weight a few times a year. I've even told him that he never mentions when I've gained weight. And that if I had lost weight every time he said so then I'd be long dead so it's obvious that I've gained in between.

He just laughed and made jokes about how silly it would be to mention someone's weight gain in the same way that we mention weight loss. Yes?? Do you not see the dichotomy??? Do you not see the irony???

He did it again yesterday when I saw him and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Then he stared at my upper body and smiled with pride for a few seconds which was weird af. My disordered brain is now saying, ""if he's proud now then he'll be so proud when you reach x lbs."" Which is chaotic and idiotic.

He has always had issues with his weight and has always dated women with issues. So he is surrounded by diet talk and can get pretty judgemental of people's bodies but especially women. As if I give a shit that he thinks Angelina Jolie is too thin. 

Is it any wonder why I grew up obsessed with my body and was dieting from the age of 7? I was surrounded by misinformed diet culture and judgement about physicalities.

I just wish he understood the effect his comments and focuses have on people. I wish he understood that not everyone looks at weight loss comments as a positive as he does and that it can be hurtful and uncomfortable. I dread seeing him when I know I've lost weight now even though I love him and miss him.

"A tip for all you binge eaters out there trying to stop - as given to me by my therapist! She called it the rule of 3s. 

Basically, make a list of safe foods (i.e. foods you general don‚Äôt binge on and feel safe eating) and a list of non safe foods (i.e. foods you tend to binge on or don‚Äôt feel comfortable eating) 

Next make a list of safe places (aka places you don‚Äôt generally binge, like a restaurant or in public with your friends) and non safe places (like your room alone) 

Lastly make a list of safe times (times you‚Äôre less likely to binge, for me it‚Äôs the morning or afternoon) and non safe times (times you‚Äôre more likely to binge, for me it‚Äôd be evening or late at night) 

From now on, 2/3 of those things need to be safe whenever you eat ANYTHING. Not in a safe place? If you‚Äôre going to eat, it has to be a safe food and at a safe time. Not eating a safe food? You bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time!!! As long as 2/3 are safe - challenge yourself with something NOT safe. 

Not only does this encourage eating non-safe foods in a healthy way, it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it.

If I‚Äôm out with people and someone takes a picture of me, I feel like I just shut down. Like any happiness just gets sucked out of me when I‚Äôm reminded of how I look.

"debunking super low metabolisms (tw numbers but they might make you feel better) okay I‚Äôm really sick of pseudoscience and people trying to further trigger themselves so i‚Äôm here to debunk all this shit for you guys. 

your metabolism at its LOWEST is likely to be around 1000 cals (assuming you‚Äôre anorexic and underweight). (https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-2974-1-37) None of that 600-800 BS. It‚Äôs harmful to tell others that their BMR can be that low, it makes people believe they HAVE to low restrict and whatnot. you‚Äôre not invalid if you do restrict to those low numbers but i‚Äôm tired of people arguing that a full body scan is super accurate and you HAVE to believe their specific anecdote about the bod pod scan they got done. It‚Äôs never gonna be totally accurate, because it‚Äôs not. Your beloved DEXA scans always underestimate your BMR so there is no way I believe that your BMR is below 900 cals (http://www.dishlab.org/pubs/LowryTomiyamaBodPod.pdf)

FURTHERMORE, indirect calorimetry (the method used in the first study) has high variability in the ill population and time of day, food and water intake, heartrate, blood pressure, and breath rate all impacts those readings (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0148607197021003168?casa_token=0ZVBihw10ZgAAAAA:AmGoHoVgV6_yD3uZquXVlVpN4YN-Ca4OJvgqVfB-oM0hx-BuootTFQ3NwSO-C3PQjkyGH293njhekyc) 

Just note that in the first study I cited, those at the lowest end of 4000 kJ burned at rest did NO exercise. Like sitting around, maybe some NEAT was calculated into it, but NO EXERCISE. Not even walking. 

I‚Äôm studying medicine and have done independent studies in undergrad on this stuff while being super anorexic (still am lmaooo) but to keep promoting low metabolisms and say you‚Äôll gain weight if you restrict to 800 cals is BS. 

and I‚Äôm 4‚Äô8‚Äù and underweight so you‚Äôd be hardpressed to find someone shorter than me and with a lower metabolism, and I STILL lost weight on 800 cal a day

"the world treats you better when you're skinny even when you're ""too"" skinny I just saw a post in which someone complained that uw people have it the worst and people treat them awfully whereas ow people are not treated w the same malice..
uhm not to invalidate anyone's experience, people are shit no matter what you look like but I promise you this, ow or thick people or what not are 100% worse off. This is not the oppression olympics, sure but, please just look around. you KNOW, that fatness is so villainzed, otherwise we all wouldn't be sitting here struggling with food and self-image. The majority of us, in this subreddit, want to be thin. And you know it.

maybe this is a very emotionally charged post but i am tired of the ""woe is me"".
I've been on both sides of the scale. people would talk over me, would stand in a cirlce in a way that would exclude me, would invalidate my feelings, not care about my opinion or outright ridicule my opinion when i was on the heavier side.
and don't even get me started on the dating aspect. The threatment is worlds apart with how everyone acted when I was my thinnest and I am not the only one that can attest, I've talked to numerous people whose weight has fluctuated a lot and they'll tel you the same thing. even when you spew the dumbest thing you can muster, if you're skinny, someone listens.

we ALL know the beauty standard, it's engraved in our brains, and we ALL know it's thinness. especially now that 90s and 2000s styles are coming back and people wear low rise jeans and crop tops. especially now that asian media is merging with western media, now that kpop is popular wherein idols are ALL underweight. especially now that summer is coming or has come and we're all expected to wear less and show more and everyone's talking about beach bodies.

anyways.

EDIT: I just hope you all know that I am NOT saying that the troubles, ridicule, pain, bullying etc. you received directly because of your thinness weren‚Äòt real - they 100% were. but saying it's the same as, or even worse than what OW people deal with, is like comparing apples with oranges. faphobia is systemic and denying that is silly.

yes, it all depends on where exactly you live and what kinds of people you're surrounded with as well as age, gender etc., it can vary! but the majority of the world is fatphobic; I can easily mention more than just the plain ridicule and disrespect like the little amount of options of clothes to choose from, or the little to no /healthy/ representation in media, etc. but I digress.

"I saw one of us in the wild yesterday was just kinda horrified Greetings, haven‚Äôt posted here in a while because, not to flex or anything, but I‚Äôve been recovered for four yearsüíÖ hell yeah brother. Onto the story. 

One of my friends has a new girlfriend, good for him, he‚Äôs been perpetually single since I‚Äôve known him. I have had dinner with her twice now and holy moly. I am horrified, not in the way you might think. 

It‚Äôs so obvious, was I that obvious??? 

She kept getting tiny servings, avoiding things like gravy and fried foods. She at one point even pretended not to know what gravy was and said she‚Äôs not in the mood to try new foods (we live in the south who the frick doesn‚Äôt know gravy???). Someone passed her a fork full of desert so she could try it and she straight up grabbed the fork, turned to her boyfriend (who was eating the same desert) and said ‚Äúopen wide‚Äù. The person who wanted her to try the desert said ‚Äú no, that was for you‚Äù AND GOT HER ANOTHER FORK FULL!! The fear and shock on her face made it seem like she just witnessed a hate crime. She then got a pasta dish and only ate the chicken off the top, talking about ‚Äúoh I‚Äôve just eaten so much today! I had such a big lunch!‚Äù And kept bringing up that alleged big lunch. 

When I was still in my active ED I guess I just thought I was some kinda ED secret agent super covert that no one suspected. Now I am petrified by the fact everyone probably knew and just didn‚Äôt say anything. I for sure did shit like that. That fork full of desert thing? Oh man I would have cried in my car and posted it on here. Or just told everyone I have a perpetual stomach ache, stomach ache or 10 years, ain‚Äôt that something. Back then I was also running on like two starved caveman brain cells. Having an ED is kinda embarrassing. Especially now that I‚Äôm doing hella good in life I wish I could just wipe that version of me from peoples minds, even if she was skinny.

i don‚Äôt recognize her, but i guess she looks a bit like me. though her skin is glowing, her hair long and healthy. >!her thighs squish together!< as she sits on the bed, but it looks cute on her, she looks very happy and healthy.

i can‚Äôt help but draw comparisons between the girl in the photo and myself. besides the obvious difference of our bodies, i am just so dull compared to her. my hair is just as long but much thinner, her full cheeks frame her carefree smile while my sunken face is adorned with disgusting chapped lips and grotesque teeth. 

i muster up the courage to suggest he change the photo. i pull up my favorite recent photo of myself, i have my clip-in hair extensions in and i like the way my elbows look. 

that‚Äôs okay, he says. this is my favorite picture of you.

but the girl in that photo isn‚Äôt me. that bright-eyed 23 year old who went all-in for recovery to push herself through beauty school, who ordered >!an impossible burger and fries!< at our three year anniversary dinner that night, became a hollowed out shell of herself who >!eats trail mix out of measuring cups!< and can‚Äôt get out of bed because she‚Äôs too cold.

it feels like looking at a photo of a stranger, or someone who died, but it‚Äôs just me two and a half years ago. i‚Äôm still here, breathing, living, looking at this photo. but i was too blinded by sickness to see the beautiful girl in the mirror, until she became nothing more than the girl on my boyfriend‚Äôs lock screen.",positive,eating_disorder,2023-02-22 13:54:31

I‚Äôve seen so many posts and comments about this. Girls upset because their boyfriend or guy they like follows a ton of Instagram models, famous female TikTok‚Äôers, skinny girls, big booty girls, whatever the case and they themselves look nothing like that.

Honestly? I find it sad if a grown man does that shit. I would be embarrassed if my friends and family saw my following list and it‚Äôs full of porn stars or something üòÇ Do they have no shame? No, they don‚Äôt. If he‚Äôs a teen, it‚Äôs more understandable but if y‚Äôall are out of high school and still like men like this‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not worth it.

If you don‚Äôt want to admit this, fine, let‚Äôs pretend they don‚Äôt use filters. It‚Äôs still embarrassing for a man to simp over girls online.

I thought the comments would be blowing up like ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs not good!‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs consistent, it could be an eating disorder‚Äù

"Seeing a few posts about people's partners and wanted to address something: Like it says, lately I've noticed a few more posts than usual (or maybe its just me) of people venting about lack of support from their partners. 

The part I want to address however, is that lately it seems people are looking for an absolutely unrealistic, selfish, or unhealthy type of support.

If your partner listens to you vent, tries to offer advice, but tells you it stresses them out when ALL you talk about is your eating disorder, that's on you. That's them trying to be supportive and set boundaries to maintain their own mental health. They can't support you if they're entirely burnt out. They are also a human being that has feelings and triggers and boundaries and you cannot expect them to put all of themselves aside for you 110% of the time, that's absolutely unsustainable and unhealthy.

If your partner listens to you vent and tries to encourage you to recover or eat or whatever that's not them fucking sabotaging you, that's them being a person who DOESN'T HAVE an eating disorder and is doing their best.

Your partner wants you to be better, to feel better. You can and should talk to them when you're stressed, let them know your triggers and what helps you, but expecting them to be a dumping ground for you to cry and vent at NONSTOP unconditionally every day and not talk about anything else?! 

Of course they want to go out to dinner! They love you and want to spend time with you doing something nice! Of course they want to go shopping, see family, watch movies, literally anything! It's not about your eating disorder! It may affect it, and that's on YOU to establish with them in a constructive way, but it is so unbelievably unrealistic and selfish to assume and expect another human being to put their entire life, wants, and needs aside for you one hundred percent of the time.

This doesn't mean don't talk to them. I've cried into my own partner, gone into hysterics, had fits over dinner, but he and I also have a communication line open where one can say ""I want to support you but am in a bad headspace to do so"" and an understanding that emotional emergencies are different than just needing to vent.

It's a two way street. The amount of support you are asking for needs to be close to or equal to what you're willing to give. I am not as mentally well as my partner. He supports me emotionally more than I support him. But if he were to reach out and say he needed something from me OR needed a break from me, that is WELL within his right and I would support that.

They are not your therapist, they are not your caretaker, they also need support FROM you.

Your partner is not your therapist. 
Your partner is not your therapist. 
Your partner is NOT your therapist.

oh my god, thank you for reading, this is such a personal gripe for me. carry on.

edit before anyone even says it: oh my god, of course this doesn't apply to abusive relationships. Of course not. And each dynamic is different and you will find your own balance. Don't @ me.

"I took my mum down a notch the other day for sharing dieting stuff with her anorexic daughter (me) and just realized it was quite the power move My mum knows I have a history with anorexia. She doesn't know I have it right now because she wouldn't really handle the info responsibly. But she noticed I lost weight, even asked if I am sick again and is getting all competitive with me.

While I was baking brownies (a new safe recipe I discovered and had a lot of pleasure with!) she messaged me how much weight she lost and how she is only eating salads now for lunch etc.

I was ready to just drop everything and skip my brownies. But I thought to myself, not now, not today. Because I literally had just discovered the recipe and I haven't had brownies in a year. She won't ruin this for me.

So I wrote her ""good for you"" and then sent her a pic of my brownies saying ""but I will have these today"". She immediately added ""isn't that a bit much for you?"" and I responded ""no, I might actually eat all of these by myself""

They are breakfast brownies with oats and everything, so eating a large one (or two) would be appropriate, but i didn't even feel like explaining that to her. Let her think that I am devouring an entire tray of normal, sugary, buttery brownies (and even if they were, so what?). I don't care.

I just wanted to show her that I really don't care how she irresponsibly shares her unhealthy diet habits with her anorexic daughter. Eat your salad. I will carry on with my brownies and not be distracted or intimidated by your need to engage in competition with me. I will not give you approval. I will not swap my brownies for salad.

"The normalization of 1200 kcal diets makes me feel like my ED ""can't be that bad"" I know that in reality that 1200 is an completely inadequate amount for me (and probably most people). But because I so often see women thinking they can eat maintenance around 1200-1400 while going to the gym (!), it becomes more difficult to remember that this can be disordered too. If everyone says 1200 is a perfectly normal amount to eat, I can't possibly be disordered when I hit that number, right? Logically I know that is wrong, but the minute I go over that number I feel like a ""fake"".

**Edit**: Thanks everyone for discussing this with me. In my head, I know exactly that 1200 isn't enough, but my ED brain still attacks me over it (recent nutrition course I took actually used 2400 kcal a day as the average TDEE for a non-pregnant woman, so the knowledge is there, but lacking some good MH).

"Literally nothing irritates me more than people who gain weight and are just ‚Äòthicc‚Äô without a stomach or rolls and dare to claim body positivity People who are all about body positivity and acceptance post pictures of themselves in bikinis and outfits.

Intermittent Fasting is going great how are you guys.


Edit to expound on my very frustrated rant: 

I think there is still a tremendous amount of gate keeping when it comes to society‚Äôs body positivity movement. The irony is not lost on me, don‚Äôt worry. Within that movement I think some bodies are widely accepted and praised because they have certain characteristics (a flat stomach being one of the most important ones to social media). In my personal opinion it is much, much easier for someone to be accepted by society‚Äôs beauty/model standards if they have these certain characteristics. I am frustrated that I do not believe I have any of these characteristics so if I were to do the same thing I would not be held to the same level of beauty as someone with ‚Äòbetter‚Äô physical attributes. 

If you‚Äôre upset with me because you think that I‚Äôm disregarding the body positivity movement as a whole I‚Äôm afraid that wasn‚Äôt the intention of my post. I meant to say some people have it easier in the eyes of social media than others. 

It is frustrating to me that someone who *seemingly* has a really effortless and happy existence who posts about body positivity has had an ‚Äòeasier‚Äô struggle than I have, because (even if they had an ED) their body will be more easily accepted than mine would be.

"EDNOS is not failed anorexia. It's a separate eating disorder. People with EDNOS are not failed anorexics any more than people with BED are failed bulimics, or vice versa. I understand that allowing people to vent their disordered thoughts is the main point of this sub, but it's starting to get on my nerves how common it is to see this sentiment. 

I have non-atypical AN, restrictive subtype. I sometimes envy people whose eating disorders aren't purely restrictive, because for me weight gain (which is always going to end up being necessary) means having to give up disordered eating behaviours completely. That really sucks when it's a crutch you're heavily reliant on, and it makes weight restoration/recovery in general very easy to get burned out on. That being said, I try my very hardest not to romanticise EDNOS, and it would never occur to me to say I'm just suuuuuper bad at binge/restrict cycles, and that I'm an EDNOS failure.

"the truth about pro-anas and ‚Äòwannarexics‚Äô now i don‚Äôt support the encouragement of eating disorders at all. anorexia, bulimia, bed, orthorexia, osfed, none of those are jokes. none of them are glamorous. all eating disorders, no matter how big or small you are, rob you of your life.

it‚Äôs offensive to look at pro ed blogs on tumblr or on twitter or websites, wherever. it‚Äôs not okay in any way, shape or form.

however,
no one who is genuinely healthy is pro ed.
no one who is genuinely healthy wants an eating disorder.
no one who has a genuinely healthy relationship with food and/or their body is pro ed.
no one who has a genuinely healthy relationship with food and/or their body desires an eating disorder.

yes, even if an eating disorder seems ‚Äúself inflicted‚Äù for ‚Äúattention‚Äù, that person likely already has underlying problems in their life. eating disorders are first and foremost a MENTAL illness, based in chemical imbalances in the same way depression is.

ANYONE who has an eating disorder or disordered eating deserves help, support, love, compassion, and to recover, even if you don‚Äôt approve of their ‚Äúreasons‚Äù.
even if you only high restrict, even if you haven‚Äôt been struggling for that long, even if you‚Äôre fat, even if you‚Äôre male, even if you‚Äôre bipoc, even if you‚Äôve never been hospitalised, even if you‚Äôve never been tube fed or knocked on death‚Äôs door, even if you don‚Äôt starve or restrict at all, even if you‚Äôve never had an exercise addiction, even if you are or have been ‚Äúpro‚Äù in the past, even if you feel like or others have called you a wannarexic, even if you‚Äôve never done other typical eating disorder behaviours but instead engaged in less common ones.
ANYONE who has an eating disorder or disordered eating deserves to be listened to, understood and recover.

and although at the end of the day i definitely don‚Äôt condone pro ana/mia or any romanticisation of eating disorders, i believe that romanticising your own mental disorder is part of the disease. it starts to consume your life so much that it becomes your identity, and therefore the most and only ‚Äòspecial‚Äô thing about you - not in a glamorous way, but you genuinely don‚Äôt know who you are without the ed. 

glorification of eating disorders is very likely to be a coping mechanism of disordered people, typically of the younger crowd, granted it is definitely not a healthy coping mechanism, but i wish people would recognise that.

"i fucking hate ed tiktok i know a lot of people talk about this on this sub, but just hear me out because i think i have a different take than i've seen in the past.

usually i think tiktok is a pretty fun app and just watch videos of animals doing cute things or people making dumb but still funny jokes. recently i've been seeing a lot of ed content, but the videos themselves aren't what i have a problem with. they've actually been pretty educational, spreading awareness, no body checking, and generally not triggering stuff. it's the comments on those videos that get me. somebody could be talking about how harmful very clearly disordered behaviours are (the most common ones i see are restricting all day and then binging at night, having fear foods, stuff like that), and every single time like half the comments will be ""wait, that's not normal? üßê""

i bet that 90% of the time the people saying those things know very well that it isn't normal and want to flaunt how *sick* they are and how *naturally* ed behaviours come to them. like, jfc this isn't the place for that. you know how competitive eds are, and you probably knew how triggering that was as you were typing it out, but you still decided to say that to get that sweet validation at the expense of others who are also struggling.

"Having a baby while you have an ED is selfish Now I know this might be controversial and I know that eating disorders are not something you choose to have, but I really want to discuss it anyway.

Today during group therapy a girl, who is really severely underweight and still very much actively disordered, told us she is having a baby. She's so happy because she and her partner have been trying for a long time, and even though I'm happy for her, I can't help myself to also be furious.

My mom also had an eating disorder while she gave birth to me and she fully recovered when I was about 2 years old. I know this had a great impact on the way I look at food now. Knowing someone is ACTIVELY trying to have a baby while being so heavily disordered is so selfish to me. It's not realistic to say she'll be recovered in 9 months either, so you just know this baby will be confronted with eating disordered behaviour in the first developing stages of their life. Even small disordered things will impact a newborn. She's very young, so saying it's now or never is not an excuse.

"I get sooo much more attention from men after loosing weight eventhough ""men like curvy girls""...riiight... Men like to say shit like ""men like curves""...Tbh I call bs on it from my own experience lmao

I used to be on the higher end of a normal BMI, I wasn't super big. I had a small frame, a big bust, a big booty and an at least proportionally small waist. All that shit men like to claim men want instead of ""those skinny girls""...

Over 20 pounds lighter and at the bottom of a normal BMI, here I am and the weather just started getting better, so I broke out the first skirts again with those skinny girl legs and the attention is fucking insane.

Multiple conventionally attractive men trying to get with me in a respectful manner just within the last couple days when I was out. I never got that much attention when I was ""curvy"" and ""thicc"".

The attention I got was mostly dumb catcalls, but when you get skinnier, all of a sudden high profile looking guys are all over you.

The kind that seem nice and would probably express their sympathy for those poor young girls growing up with those bEaUty sTaNdArDs and say they totally support body positivity or what not.

Nothing wrong with liking what you like, but please at least be honest about it.

I think what makes it powerful is that if I try to imagine what any of you look like, based on limited information, it's basically impossible. Like, when I think of skinny, I have no idea if my perception is what you think of. Or what 'overweight' means to you. Especially without numbers it's so vague.

"i saw a girl in the food court today, and i nearly cried bc it reminds me so much of me she sat there with her phone, her mom got food for her, i was eating the exact same thing, and because it is the covid season, everybody wears mask unless they are eating. 

mom brought her food, left it on her side, and proceeds to go buy her own food. 
she stirred and mixed the food around, never once taking her mask off to consume the food. 

mom comes back with her own food, started eating her own food, i was just observing, observing if she will remove her mask to finally eat the food. mask never came off, while her mom picks on her daughter‚Äôs food, from the duration that they were there, her mask never came off, except for when mom brought her plain 0 calories water, mask came off for 10 seconds, quickly put mask back on. 

she doesn‚Äôt have that typical ed look, we all know that means skinny to a point of exhaustion, but looking at her face, i knew, she was sick. 

i nearly cried, i was there, i was her not too long. my mom had to buy me my food, my mom had to mix them for me, beg me to have a mouth, mom had to eat my food. 

there was a girl, looking and staring at me weirdly, judging me probably. while my mom ate my food, while she begs me to eat. and today i became the girl, looking and watching. 

i never went up to the girl, because i was overwhelmed with feelings, feelings like being so fucking sorry to my mom, for doing that to her, now that i saw her, it felt like seeing myself. 

i hope i was subtle enough with my watching, but i just wish she knew that i wasn‚Äôt judging her at all, that it gets better, that i wanna give her a tight hug, and tell her everything will be better soon, it would be tough, but it will go over and she will start enjoying food again.  i am so so sorry that this happening to you. so fuckibg sorry.",positive,eating_disorder,2020-09-04 05:54:57

And I get it. It's heartbreaking how many of us gone through this. I have. I know that's the way we tend to see it, that we intentionally sought this out. But did we?

In my opinion? No. We didn't. Because normal, neurotypical people don't sit and think ""yeah I'm going to get an eating disorder today"". They don't stumble upon pro ana blogs and think ""wish I could be like that"". They find it sad and strange.

You have a predisposition in the first place. EDs are more than a way of eating and a body type to worship; it's trauma, psychology, socialization, body image... So much more than downloading Tumblr and deciding to fast.

"A warning from ya girl with COVID-19 Like a lot of the Seattlite members of the sub, I went from ambivalent about the ""I hope I catch coronavirus"" jokes to bristling at them when things started to get really scary here. In spite of showing extreme caution (minimizing outings, sanitizing my phone regularly, washing my hands, keeping outside clothes off my furniture, etc), I have COVID-19.

Y'all, this shit is not fun. It's not something mild like a norovirus type stomach flu where your body ejects food from both ends and you lose weight from an involuntary fast. I know this disorder puts macabre ideas in our heads where something like that sounds helpful, at least in the abstract, but that is not what this is.

I have a mild case by all accounts, and even so, I can't recall the last time I felt this horrible. For context, last year I underwent chemo for breast cancer -- this is worse. My head is killing me, everything hurts all over, the fever left me sweating through my bedding, my chest is heavy like the time I had bacterial pneumonia for a month, and just walking from my bed to the kitchen for a drink leaves me faint.

Please, please be careful, you guys. I'm lucky in that my son is a teen who is eager to take care of me so I can stay in bed, but I know that's a privilege that some people don't have.

- Take every possible precaution to limit exposure so that if you do come into contact, you have a low initial viral load and your body can begin fighting before it is overcome. 
- Prepare in whatever ways you can for if/when you do get sick -- have cold medicine, inhalers, whatever you like to eat and drink when you're feeling bad on hand.
- If you live alone, make a group chat with friends or family so you can keep people in the loop easily if you begin showing symptoms.
- Look into who you would need to contact for evaluation and/or diagnosis if you became ill.

Just please, please take this seriously. It's not ""just the flu"", and even if you're young and healthy, it can seriously fuck you up -- even in a mild case.",negative,eating_disorder,2020-03-21 18:21:43

"Skinny Cool Girl Long time lurker, recently becoming active. I love each and every one of you to pieces. This sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist.

Im still newly ""in recovery"" I think, but this has been my longest, healthiest bout (36 days now compared to 3-5 day binge cycles my whole life). I wanted to share what I think of as my ""secret to success"" just in case it works on a single other person.

The goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego, Skinny Cool Girl. 

SCG is basically my imaginary role model, who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist.

I wasnt doing so well on the hot part. Body dysmorphia or not I'm still not sure, but damn it I want to be SCG!

So I decided to...start something *else* SCG does (besides look good). To start rock climbing. To get my first tattoo. To start hiking. To try a kickboxing class. To go out with friends. I just went ""skinny dipping,"" no pun intended. My next step is to go dancing for the first time. I'm planning a backpacking trip for next summer. I'm going to class so I can get the degree SCG has.

SCG doesnt like everything she tries, but she tries anything. And she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things, she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out.

Basically *I* dont want to do those things, but SCG does. And I want to be SCG. So I go, and I have had a great time and maybe I'm getting a little bit closer to being her.

What I'm saying is: who will you be when you are YOUR Skinny Cool Girl? Will you go skydiving? Will you sing karaoke? Will you dress in bright bold clothes? Will you flirt with someone? Will you eat balanced meals, or apply for a better job? Will you perform or display your art? Will you go to bed on time?

What leap will you take someday in order to become her? When will she do *insert activity here* for the first time?

Can you make it happen now?

Take one of the things future SCG has about her that you dont have, that isn't weight related, and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment.

The brain, your soul, who you want to be does not change after you lose weight. Go be her. You have to *become* her still. Weight is only a small part of the equation. You'll catch up to SCG. Dont waste time while you think you're fat not being cool girl, or else you'll lose the weight and find out that SCG doesn't exist yet.",positive,eating_disorder,2019-09-09 07:00:51

"To the person in their 20s looking at skinny teenagers on tik tok... Delete the app now.

Remember how much it sucked being a teenager, and that the perfect-looking girl getting validated in the comments is probably struggling with her own issues; and those are rarely shared on social media.  
The sexualisation of young people is a serious problem, and by internalizing the narrative that they are more attractive than you'll ever be or were, we are losing voices to counter this problematic development that is growing more and more dominant in our current society.  
We all had to go through a moment in our young-adulthood in which we had to come to terms with the fact that there are people out there that view us as sexual objects. At the time our risk/reward systems were so fucked up by cognitive developments and hormones that we may not have realised the dangers those people could pose. We've all found ourselves in terrible situations because of that I bet.  
Now imagine that during that confusing time you were showing yourself off for thousands of people to see and to hear thousands of opinions about the way you look and dress. That must be so very mentally exhausting, and addicting in a way.  
For some of these young girls this behaviour is not coming from a centered place, so have compassion for them rather than resenting them for their desirability.  
Forgive yourself for thinking these thoughts. Just because you're an adult doesn't mean you will always find yourself doing what is good for you. A good start would be to stop engaging with this content and triggering yourself. You don't have to infantilize yourself to be attractive. You don't even owe being attractive to anyone. I know it's hard to want better for yourself; it;s why you use obsessions with food and aesthetic to cope anyway, but maybe take this small step and see where it takes you.  
I promise you will feel better when you delete tiktok.

"The BEST call with a girl from school There‚Äôs this girl who I‚Äôve never been super close to, but she is really sweet and thoughtful, so she started bringing me food when she realized that I don‚Äôt bring any in myself. So she called me tonight and asked if I‚Äôd eat cookies and a banana tomorrow and if she should put it on my desk before people see in case I‚Äôm self conscious. I explained that it‚Äôs mostly a disordered eating thing, where I want to prevent myself from eating so I don‚Äôt bring any food, but I still really appreciate it. She said she understood and we talked for almost an hour, with her just giving me low-calorie Indian recipes and telling me how to make them/where to get the food. Before we hung up she said, don‚Äôt think about calories, you don‚Äôt have to look in the mirror, get sleep and take deep breaths if you can‚Äôt sleep, I‚Äôll have food for you tomorrow and you‚Äôll eat it if you can, I love you and you‚Äôre beautiful.

"Can I be honest? (May be a super unpopular opinion) I might get a lot of hate for this, but I miss proed spaces. 

I miss having a space to talk about it, and talk about what I ate, see what others ate, without acting all secretive about it like this sub.

Here, people STILL talk about what they ate, and often will mention the meager amount of calories it was, or go in depth about their 6k+ calorie binges, the only difference is here, you have to pretend that you hate restriction and losing weight again after recovery. Every post about relapsing or shitposts along the lines of ‚ÄúWhen you tell your friend to eat healthy and you go home and eat 4 strawberries and sleep for dinner‚Äù there‚Äôs so many comments like ‚Äúomg same! We‚Äôre so messed up lol‚Äù

There are HARDLY real recovery posts here. It‚Äôs basically a place to get validation for your binges being okay or your restricting being *so* awful when the posts are lowkey flexes. 

This sub poses as a place to get help for recovery and share thoughts with other people in recovery but it‚Äôs just....not really that. People post things like ‚ÄúI stay away from this sub when I‚Äôm not restricting so I don‚Äôt feel bad‚Äù why would you feel bad about recovering in a RECOVERY SUB???

It‚Äôs just a proed sub except anytime you say anything remotely proed you get fuckin swarmed and told you‚Äôre a shitty person by other people who probably agree with what you said. Nobody should put other people down for their body types, and nobody should tell people that their binges are disgusting, or share thinspo images, but talking about it aloud to yourself is your choice. People say proed things here all the time, they just pretend they hate thinking that way when they clearly don‚Äôt.

Obviously I don‚Äôt know her personally, so all of this is just my own opinions. I wish her nothing but health and happiness but I wish people would stop treating her like she‚Äôs this sweet girl who can do no wrong.

She deliberately posts images of herself akin to thinspo, ignores the thousands of triggered people in her comments, and has built an entire career upon her disorder. This is an adult. An adult who has suffered with this hell and still fails to give a fuck about the people she is influencing. There are young kids in her comments idolizing her body and emaciation.

It would be one thing if she was just an influencer struggling with anorexia, but it is an entirely different thing to actively profit off of what is essentially thinspo. 

Obviously I feel horrible for her that she suffers from this illness, and that the people in her life seem like such terrible enablers, but it makes me so goddamn angry that she refuses to take responsibility for anything, and just hides under this label of ‚Äúnice.‚Äù IMO she is a very manipulative person, and on some level has an awareness of how she is influencing her audience.

"Seen a lot of terrible boyfriend posts in here lately. Just wanted to share about my husband... Quick Background: 

* I was in toxic relationship before I met my husband, and I wish someone had shaken me and told me that it was not normal and that it was not worth trying to build a lasting relationship with a guy who acted so casually cruel and didn't make an effort to care about my well-being.

* I've been with my husband for ten years, and we've been married for six. 

* I've struggled with periods of binge eating and periods of extreme restriction for more than half of my life, now.  While I've been with my husband, my BMI's been underweight, normal, overweight, and even obese. He's seen it all--most more than once.  

My husband has never said anything negative about my appearance. Ever. Not even once. Not even when I've asked.  Not even when I intentionally make my curly hair super messy and wild to ask him what he thinks as a joke (he'll say he loves my crazy hair, or that it's ""cute"").  He has said the same positive things about how he finds me sexy when I've been at my fattest and when I've been at my skinniest.  If he has a secret preference, he will never, ever reveal it (believe me, at my lowest I have tried to trick him into admitting it).  After years of consistent compliments and no negativity, I actually trust that he doesn't care about my weight.  

I never once had to tell him not to comment on my weight. He just wouldn't do that *because he's a good man*. 

We've talked about my ED, and how he can intervene when he's worried about me without me feeling attacked or out of control.  He'd known about my issues, but when he wanted to learn ways he could help, he chose to bring it up at a relaxed time that was good for both of us, away from mealtimes--not in the middle of a fight about why I wouldn't eat soup or something.  

Now, when he notices I'm restricting, he'll ask what he can make me that I will eat--and he'll bring it, no questions asked. So many lovingly-prepared salted tomatoes, you guys.  

When he notices I've been binging, he'll start asking if we can do things that will give me an endorphin hit that aren't food-related (plan a trip, go for walks on the beach together, play with our pets, have sex, etc.). 

He does not comment judgmentally on my eating.  No, ""Wow, that's a lot!"" or ""I made you all of this and you're only having ONE stuffed pepper??"" from him.  

*One time* I was on antibiotics and had to eat three meals a day.  When I sat down for lunch on a day I'd also had breakfast, he commented, ""Oh, you're eating a lot today,"" and *immediately* corrected with, ""I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said it like that. I meant that it's nice to see you eat three meals a day. I get to spend more time cooking and eating with you."" That is literally the only time this man made any slightly critical comment about my eating in ten years, and I didn't have to explain to him why it might be triggering. 

When I see you guys posting about men who are, at best, careless, or, at worst, cruel, it breaks my heart. I've been there. I thought it was what I deserved, or that he was just being honest, or that I could finally figure out the magic way to explain to him why I was worth being kind to in a way that stuck.  I didn't know that it could be so much better.  You all deserve so much better.",positive,eating_disorder,2022-01-18 16:11:21

"I almost died from omitting drug information Throwaway because my friends and my gf have reddit, and I‚Äôm cross posting this on TIFU as well. This is something that I have never had to think about until today.

Thursday afternoon, I started having extreme angina (chest pain). It radiated up to my shoulder, and I couldn‚Äôt stop sweating. I immediately called the ems because my girlfriend was freaking the f out, and was in no condition to take me to the ER. (She gets panic attacks over medical stuff), and I was starting to have trouble breathing. 
   Here‚Äôs the part where I fucked up. One of the paramedics was asking me questions about medical history and medications I was on. He then asked about ED medications. I had taken about 50 mg the day before, but I didn‚Äôt want my girlfriend to know about it, because I hadn‚Äôt had time to talk to her about it yet and I was embarrassed. BIG MISTAKE. 
    They gave me nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator. Turns out viagra is a vasodilator as well. My pressure bottomed out, and I almost died. I could have ended my life that day, and I would have never seen anyone that I loved ever again because I told a fucking stupid lie. I swear it isn‚Äôt worth it to be embarrassed. Please, please always tell medical personnel about your medical history, and any drugs you take, because not doing so could cost you your life. I had to learn this the hard way, but please be aware of the side effects of ED medications, especially if you‚Äôve had heart issues. They can interact with a lot of different drugs. 

TL;DR: ED meds are always relevant to medical history, don‚Äôt lie to your gf.

"Fuck you for using me to virtue signal A clearly overweight woman saw my food diary after a date with my boyfriend. It was 1114 calories worth of junk food, but that was my only 'meal' of the day. I usually eat a lot healthier, but I just wanted to have a nice movie evening with the man I love.

She then proceeds to go on about how she can't even bring herself to eat 1200 calories a day, and is 'often 700 calories under that!' and that she should 'eat more like I do so she can get those calories in'.

As fatphobic as this sounds, seeing a borderline obese person virtue signal on my amount of food, and being completely extra about how much I'm apparently stuffing myself with compared to her made me actually want to kill myself.

*Edit - just for some clarification on why I specifically latched onto her weight I'm pasting a reply here that I made on another comment. 

""I mentioned it in another reply, but I think it may have been super clumsily worded and therefore my meaning didn't come across - I feel bad, but her weight is part of the reason I was so badly triggered. I felt overly gluttonous and therefore experienced absolute sickining guilt over how much I had eaten, because if someone with a significantly higher tdee than myself only needs 400-500 calories a day as postulated, then what the fuck was I doing eating over 1000? Why did I need so much food to sustain my smaller body, if a bigger body can do with so much less? I basically managed to gaslight myself into believing I have reverse body dysmorphia, because if she eats so little compared to me, how much do I *actually* weigh. It just sent me into a tailspin.

"So many viewers agree that ""To the Bone"" does not accurately reflect their experience of eating disorders. So why does it have such a hold over us? ""To the bone"", starring Lilly Collins as Ellen, a twenty year old anorexic - if you've come across it, you'll probably know that it's highly popular amongst viewers suffering from eating disorders (particularly on ED Tumblr). 

It's intended as a story of hope and recovery, with a brutally honest depiction of the impact an eating disorder has on somebody and the people around them. 

I'd argue that its appeal is so strong because it's an unrealistic interpretation of the lived experience of someone with an eating disorder - which shows a standard or ideal that lots of us might aspire towards in our most difficult times. 

Ellen is tiny, she's also strikingly pretty, and she also has perfect control and apparently doesn't experience hunger at all. How is that realistic? I don't think I've met anyone yet who doesn't face a daily battle with cravings, internal conflicts, obsession with choosing what to eat, agonising over what they ate, bingeing, exercising intensely to get rid of it... the whole shebang.

"does anyone else wanna be thin so they look classy Growing up I always hear curvy people being called trashy for wearing some piece that people would call a slim person ‚Äúclassy‚Äù for wearing, the only difference is the other has more ass or boobs than the other. So now I basically equate thinness to sophistication, I mean, Audrey Heburn is the poster child for all things classy. 

I‚Äôve been poor all my life and I always wanted to appear wealthy and I believe looking classy is part of that but my wide hips and fatter butt just make it impossible and it‚Äôs probably one of the reasons why I developed an eating disorder. Even then, it‚Äôs not like my body structure‚Äôs ever gonna change, I‚Äôm always gonna have wide hips so I‚Äôll never really look ‚Äúclassy‚Äù which is really frustrating. I feel like I‚Äôm always gonna hate myself. 

Does anyone else aspire to look ‚Äúclassy‚Äù too? Also why do you think being slim is seen as ‚Äúclassier‚Äù than being thick?? I always thought it‚Äôs because they practice moderation or have really great self-control, but there‚Äôs the racism angle too because some non-white communities may have different standards like being thicker.

"Someone bought me a hotdog I went to therapy this morning and saw the hotdog cart at the park across the street. I mentioned to my therapist I might get a hotdog after therapy. So after therapy I found myself nervously waiting in line at the hotdog cart. There were two men ahead of me.

"Kids shouldn't know what calories are. Period. I love those Kids Try videos on YouTube.

I was watching the Y2K one and one of the questions they asked the little girl (probably, like 6 or 7) was, about SunnyD, ""what do you think the difference between this and orange juice is?"" 

She responded with, ""more sugar and more calories. My dad likes to stay away from things with too many calories."" Or something close to that. Edit: to be clear, the question wasn't what bugged me; I was expecting her to say something like ""I don't think it's made from oranges.""

My heart broke. PARENTS NEED TO STFU ABOUT THIS SHIT. YOUR BABY DOES NOT NEED TO BE ASSOCIATING CALORIES WITH WITH THINGS THAT NEED TO BE AVOIDED. FIRE SHOULD BE AVOIDED. POISON SHOULD BE AVOIDED. RUNNING INTO THE STREET SHOULD BE AVOIDED... CALORIES ARE LITERALLY ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL AND YOUR CHILD SHOULD NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE BELIEF THAT FEWER IS BETTER WHEN.THEY'RE.STILL.GROWING. I CAN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW.

Edit: 

Ohhhh boy. I was not expecting to return to this. 

Instead of rifling through the individual responses, I want to clarify a few things in general:

I made a major mistake with the title of this post. I didn't even really think about it, honestly, and posted it when I was grumpy. It straight up says something that I didn't really mean, which is that kids should not know what calories are. As if it's that simple ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

What I actually meant was that young (like, before eight, give or take) don't benefit from placing numeric value on items of sustenance. Everyone is entitled to their opinions on this of course, but my opinion is that placing that value has harmful implications versus, say, explaining that a calorie is a unit of energy to fuel our bodies, which was mentioned and I am on board with. Furthermore, for a parent to impart onto a child that fewer calories = good is ridiculous; an apple may have more calories than a cracker, but we can all agree which has more nutritional value. Young children - again, YOUNG - don't necessarily have the context yet to deduce that on their own. 

I would never suggest hiding the fact that calories exist if a child was to ask about them. It's like a kid asking where babies come from, right? If your five year old asks you, you're probably going to give them age appropriate, honest answer, but you're probably not going to sit that five year old down to give them the birds and the bees chat unsolicited. Proper education is good, y'all!

Of course this is a complex and controversial subject and I so, so appreciate all of you who have shared your opinions and experiences. There is no catch-all-correct way to handle something like this for every kid and all of us here have especially passionate opinions on this subject in particular. The best I can hope for is that future generations have better relationships with this thing that is required for survival (read: food) than I do. 

The above is still not perfect clarification, but I hope it better explains what my intentions were in posting this.

"Growing Up ‚Äúugly‚Äù Validates Our ED One of my (20F) guy friends was having a hard time today. The dude is like 6‚Äô2, incredibly handsome, works out, studies engineering, amazing teeth and energy, but still struggles with self esteem, BAD. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because I tell no jokes when I say this man is a solid 9.5/10 by universal  standards. I was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better (like that EVER works with anybody), and he finally breaks: tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food. Even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldn‚Äôt shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid: fat, ugly, unloveable. If anything, ‚Äúglowing up‚Äù made him more insecure. I understood exactly what he meant. 

I grew up with cystic acne, chubby, awkward. I had no friends, nobody took me seriously, nobody saw me. Cue my junior year of high school, an eating disorder, platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity, kindness, respect and attention. I saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it, no matter the cost on my physical and mental health, and it proved 100% of my fears about people treating me badly because I was ‚Äúugly‚Äù. 

My friend and I both agreed that ‚Äúglowing up‚Äù didn‚Äôt make us any more confident: in fact, it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ED behavior. We know what it‚Äôs like to be ‚Äúugly‚Äù, and we know how much better life treats you when you‚Äôre thin and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.  We‚Äôll do anything not to go back, and we‚Äôre constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it. That we‚Äôre ‚Äúfat‚Äù again. We know it happened once and know that it could happen again. 

Both of us know that in reality our version of ‚Äúfat‚Äù is probably closer to healthy, and don‚Äôt judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards. Can anyone else relate??

Edit: typo, and thanks for the gold friend <3

Edit 2: Wow, thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive.

And yes we can argue people should look for posts before they post their own post to avoid repetitive posts, but honestly, I don‚Äôt mind at all. Often we are not in the right frame of mind to look through posts. We are freaking out and need quick reassurance, an answer or to vent right now. If people are restricting, sometimes the concentration needed to read through prior posts just isn‚Äôt there.

"eating disorders are so expensive i‚Äôm cycled through BED to Anorexia and everything in between


it doesn‚Äôt matter if i‚Äôm restricting, binging, binging and purging, or attempting some sort of recovery. food is expensive. 


Restricting? let‚Äôs buy individually wrapped pre portioned baby food at $4 per 15 grams of some sort of ‚Äúpuff‚Äù. buy 27 of these. $30 a week on diet coke or your preferred poison. let‚Äôs buy this sugar free syrup for $10, use it in all one night because your body thinks it‚Äôs energy (hah). pour 5 tbsps of not-sugar ($15) onto your fancy fat free sugar free yoghurt ($10) to make it bearable. spend $30 on vegetables that you‚Äôll either never touch, or you‚Äôll eat it all to full the void without the calories. allow yourself to order a gourmet pizza ($25) but end up chewing and spitting it. drink through a litre of almond milk a day with varying amounts of tea and coffee. $3, daily. 


binging? hungry jacks drive thru. ubereats. $40 on chocolate that is gone within the hour. replacing other peoples food you ate hoping to god they won‚Äôt notice. re-buying that same food because you went on another binge in the process of trying to replace said food. 


purging? all of the above minus any minuscule scrap of nutrient. 

also teeth decay, a whole other financial crisis :) 


recovery? safe food sourced from the hidden rivers guarded by an ancient tribe and nurtured and/or hand crafted by the village women. either that or more baby food. all organic, of course.

"I really hate what keto has done to my community Spicy title I know, and it‚Äôs not really keto but diet culture as a whole. I‚Äôm Asian, and my country‚Äôs cuisine is entirely based on rice. We eat rice every meal, we eat rice noodles when we dine out, we eat rice desserts, we eat various kinds of rice on our Lunar New Year. Rice has always been a symbol of warmth and health, a humble food that is beloved and cherished even in its plainest state - lots of people love eating a steaming bowl of plain white rice, maybe with a lil bit of soy sauce or fish sauce on top. 

And in 7th grade, I was taught that white rice is why I was fat and I gotta stop eating it. And now I‚Äôm terrified of rice, I‚Äôm constantly fantasize of the day I get skinny enough to eat rice. 

Keto is getting so popular in my country, and I‚Äôm so scared for little boys and girls hearing about the devil that is white rice. Hell, I‚Äôm scared for the women and men of all ages hearing bullshit about how it has fuck all nutritions and that‚Äôs why we gotta stop eating it altogether. Our diets are very balanced - 1 cup to 2 of rice per meal with soups/poached veggies, a meat dish, a stir fry/pan fried dish. Keto has no business here. 

And I‚Äôm targeting keto specifically bc it‚Äôs a bullshit diet that disguised as scientific or some shit. It‚Äôs taking advantage of this carb moral panic that will be out of fashion sooner or later, much like fat before. Debunking keto is getting more popular nowadays, but the craze is only getting started in my country.

"Went to buy junk food...came home with a cat Exactly as it sounds. 

Left the house with my boyfriend on Tuesday to buy ""groceries"", which to him means pop-tarts, frozen pizzas and cookies. 

Somewhere along the literally 5 minute drive we started talking about cats. I said I wished I could pet a cat because I was so stressed from school. So then we stopped at pet smart to ""pet the cats"". As we were walking inside, my boyfriend said ""I hate cats, so we are not getting one. We are only petting them. This is a de-stress trip to pet cats and that is it.""

Within 5 minutes of ""petting the cats"" my boyfriend was hand selected by a big fat male tabby who stuck his paw through the cage and gently tapped him on the ear. I look over a few minutes later and he has this big cat cradled in his arms, telling me we have to have him. 

So now we have a cat. And it's been 3 days and we never returned to the grocery store for the junk food run. 

And I'm thankful for this because now I get to go to the grocery store by myself today and select all the good and healthy foods I want without his influence üòç

I will use numbers just saying, idk how to censor it sorry

I track my poop routine. It helps me worry less about weight gain, thankfully.
The last time I pooped was April 23.

I tried every online hack to poop, tried a coffee Mono for 3 days, tried every laxative in the shops near me.

So, how'd I poop?

Vitamin C. I took about 6000mg and was sitting within the same hour. It was excruciatingly painful and I'm bleeding. But guess what? It's over. I'm normal again. Thankfully no longer in pain.

You want to know how much poop was in my guts? How horrifically bloated I was?

10. Kilograms. Of. Shit. 

Before I literally looked pregnant. My stomach was huge, I was constantly in pain. Every time I ate it hurt more. 

I'm going to start recovery because of this incident. Truly a wakeup call. I'll likely never post here again, but I just wanted to share with everyone that eating disorders are HORRENDOUS. Anyone glamourizing it really needs to pull their head out of their ass..

Binge culture ruined my life. I was born and raised in Texas and I can‚Äôt speak for anywhere else but I know that here and in a lot of the USA southern states, bigger is better. That means bigger food portions, bigger clothing sizes, bigger seating, bigger drinks, everything is catered towards larger sizes. I hear about ‚Äúdiet culture‚Äù a lot but down here where I live it really doesn‚Äôt exist, maybe for certain communities, but for the most part people here revel in constantly binge eating foods that are extremely rich, sickeningly sweet, oily, cheese smothered, hot & spicy, and eating massive portions of them. It is very difficult to find foods that are low in calorie or even any type of specialty food for people with medical conditions or food allergies. Vegans are openly ridiculed and bullied for not eating meat, to the point where even products that are somewhat associated with veganism are openly derided by our STATE LEGISLATORS (see: Ted Cruz‚Äôs rant against tofu and soy products, which was extremely ironic considering Texas is one of the largest producers of soy in the entire USA).

When I started at my job, they didn‚Äôt have a uniform in my size, but they had plenty of L-3XL uniforms. I had to size up to a medium and it was the only medium they had left. Literally Everyone I know eats out at restaurants or takeout 3-4 times per week, sometimes every single day for lunch, and this is accepted as normal. People who bring their own lunches in to work are seen as weird, even if they can‚Äôt afford to eat out with their higher paid colleagues. My friends and coworkers are constantly complaining about their health effects caused by being overweight, but they don‚Äôt want to change how/what they eat and they laugh and joke about their previous heart attacks or diagnoses of diabetes as if it‚Äôs no big deal. Heart disease is the #1 killer in Texas even though it is highly preventable. The culture has been this way since I was a child.

This is the culture that gave me an eating disorder, not diet culture. A binge culture telling me that bigger is better, that eating 2 full sized portions meant to feed 2 people can and should be eaten just by me, in one sitting, and that that is ‚Äútreating myself‚Äù. A capitalist culture telling me to buy and consume as much as possible, because that will make me happy. A culture blasting advertisements in my eyes and ears everywhere I look, telling me this new food product is what is going to make me happy, even if it‚Äôs just for a few minutes. A culture that has normalized eating 3 servings of ice cream in one sitting as a way to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô you when you are sad. A culture that has massive potlucks at church every Sunday and has normalized the sensation of eating 3 full plates or more until you are uncomfortably full, even to the point of damaging your stomach. This is binge culture. This is normal in my community, and it‚Äôs devastating it. 

Binge culture is just as insidious as diet culture, even more so in fact, because the binge culture is supported and subsidized by the massive corn industry(which is in EVERYTHING- corn syrup, corn starch, even things like citric acid, that‚Äôs from corn too!), the 528 billion dollar fast food industry, the \~200 billion dollar soda industry, and the \~105 billion dollar chocolate industry (which relies heavily on CHILD SLAVERY! See Nestles 2014 labor report in West Africa). Compare that to the \~72 billion dollar diet industry (and that‚Äôs generous) and tell me which culture is more influential. Here in Texas the winner is clear. The only reason diet culture even exists in the first place is because of these highly influential and powerful food industries that have messed up the way that people are meant to intuitively eat, which is not possible in an artificial environment where people are constantly bombarded with food and images of food that are artificially engineered to be hyper palatable, visually pleasing, unsatiating, physically addicting, and constantly available wherever you go. THIS is why I developed BED. Not because of diet culture, but because binge culture is so accepted and normalized where I live that it is seen as the norm. I know this sub caters more towards restrictive eating disorders, but BED is just as valid of a disorder as AN, and us folks struggling with BED deserve to be heard. I struggle with extremely disordered binge eating, but I don‚Äôt feel like I can find support among some of these subs because they often facilitate the binge culture mindset and trigger me into bingeing. Sentiments like ‚Äúrestriction always leads to a binge‚Äù make my mind say ‚Äúwell you might as well just binge and not even try because any form of self control = restriction I guess‚Äù. Sentiments like ‚Äúif you refuse any food offered to you at all that is restriction and that is a Disordered Mindset‚Äù being touted as ‚Äòrecovery progress‚Äô, when for me, the inability to refuse food is a hallmark of the BED mindset. This is not helpful to me and other BED sufferers and is actually enabling my form of eating disorder, which is ironic for a sub that claims to be for only pro-recovery. I just wish I could find the support of like minded people who have suffered the way I have because of the way we were raised.",negative,eating_disorder,2021-05-07 19:13:42

It seems every person with a knowledge of eating disorders knows exactly how these people maintain their trim figures. Yet a quick scroll through the comments always shows a vast majority of people praising their 'good metabolism' (yes metabolism varies from person to person, but not so much that you can maintain 110lbs while embarking on regular '20k calorie challenges').

"Turns out, really skinny people just don‚Äôt eat very much An honest observation from being hyper-aware from my ED is that I‚Äôve noticed that my (really) skinny friends simply do not ‚Äòconsume‚Äô very much. Because they‚Äôre actually too busy or they have small portion sizes or they don‚Äôt finish meals because they‚Äôre too full or too picky.

Sometimes I know it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre also struggling with disordered habits themselves, but with a good amount of people I know very well, they just aren‚Äôt that big into food.

My brother‚Äôs a good example. He‚Äôs been underweight his whole life, and it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs just never been very interested in food. Plus he‚Äôs really lazy, so he wouldn‚Äôt go out of his way to buy or make food. Growing up, he ate his meals and didn‚Äôt care for ice-cream or sweets or soda, and as an adult, he eats full meals and doesn‚Äôt snack.

I mean it‚Äôs not like I *just* discovered CICO. I‚Äôve known it for years and knowing it fuelled my ED because I became addicted to how true and simple it was as a ‚Äòrule‚Äô.

"The normalisation of doing whatever it takes to be thin in Japan is real .-. So; I've been studying in Japan for several months, and to be honest, the thin culture here is insane.

I work at a clothing store and today I tried helping a woman who comes in often, but I've never really talked to her because she always leaves quickly without buying anything. This time she tried on some jeans and she looked so freaking sad it was heartbreaking. She then told me she is sick of hating herself this much and that she had been suffereing from anorexia since she was about 15. Because of her ed she was'nt able to have children and she said every partner she ever had left because at some point they simply couldn't keep watching her destroy herself and she told me how lonely she was. Her ed destroyed her teeth, her digestive system, she lost almost all of her hair and because of all her health problems she was'nt able to work since her 40s. She told me she missed out on everything in life and she never even went on vacation. I don't know how this conversation even happened, she probably needed someone to talk to but it really hit home. I've been struggleing with an ed for almost 10 years now and If I don't change my future will look very similar.
